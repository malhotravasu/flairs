#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

Instead of accepting his mistake, he is now trying to mud-sling those people by creating morphed tweets.

So, Richa Chadha and few others [shared](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EWW4A-aUYAE5iuF.jpg) a picture of Rishi Bagree's tweet on July 10th 2016. The tweet says 

""Dear @AmitShah 
We spend almost 5-6 hrs/daily defending BJP
Ignoring our Family
Ignoring our health

& now a BJP min is branding us as TROLL""

A little background regarding the tweet, on July 8th 2016, Maneka Gandhi (then BJP minister) [approached IT Ministry to deal with abusive trolls](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/maneka-gandhi-social-media-bullies-beware-maneka-gandhi-war-on-trolls-328121-2016-07-08). It is [said](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cm-0gNCXYAEG5Tx.jpg) that she has given a list of abusive twitter (and FB) users to twitter India (and FB India) and asked them to block such users. There were some reports that the list included some of the BJP IT cell members. And that caused outrage among the BJP IT cell members, leading to tweets such [like this](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CnFtYhGWEAAO0n1.jpg) from rishi (notice the date, just two days after Maneka's attack on abusive users).

After 4 years, some people found that tweet to be funny and shared it on twitter, Richa Chadha did the same. Then came the moron Bagree with [absurd reasons](https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1253611143282622465) claiming the tweet she shared is fake and [threatened](https://twitter.com/rishibagree/status/1253624497644552192) her for legal action if she didn't apologize to him. She then [apologized](https://twitter.com/RichaChadha/status/1253623633756520449) and deleted the shared tweet. Without knowing the truth, as usual, bhakts jumped the bandwagon of bullying her and even asked the moron rishi to ""not leave her"" wtf?

Then few twitter users proved that the tweet is not fake and the moron tweeted that for real [Proof 1](https://twitter.com/andh_bhakth_/status/1253628890200698880) [Proof 2](https://twitter.com/Joydas/status/1253678202926424064) [Proof 3](https://twitter.com/zoo_bear/status/1253702288419336198) [Proof 4](https://twitter.com/CatWomaniya/status/1253724299464265733).

Then the fellow bhakts came to bagree's help. [Here's](https://twitter.com/choga_don/status/1253704087046107136) one moron trying his hand at Microsoft paint, trying to mud-sling Richa and bagree retweeted it (deleted later, can't find the link rn). I mean how illiterate and idiotic one must be to not believe the proofs given and still hate people for telling the truth?

This is how propaganda works, guys, even if you debunk the fake news and present them with the facts, they are gonna abuse you and peddle fake news defaming you.

Sharing this with you guys because I thought that bagree's tweet of pleading to Amit Shah was funny, I mean working your ass off for a party only to be recognized as a *troll* by the same party minister? lmao, I would definitely hang myself in shame."," His “defense” was funny, given that twitter has updated the UI multiple times over the last 4 years. “Rounded DP vs Square DP”, “my username has a flag in it”. But then who am I fooling: Logic and chaddis are opposite ends of a spectrum.

There are people on his case though, so I guess that’s fine. The IT cell people are as stupid as the boss 😂 That Bagree tweet is one of the cringiest shit I have ever read. I’m not surprised he tried to distance from it yesterday by claiming it to be fake. I’m also not surprised that he did not stop for one second to think that the lie would be called out almost immediately because that tweet is what most of us know him for.

I bet the guy is now boasting about how he falsely made the lady apologise.

Edit: just saw this tweet from someone I can only assume is a social right-wing influencer because he has got a blue tick under that  Rishi “I deny my cringey past” Bagree tweet thread:


“She has just added any random fake id, actually, it's common in all Bollywood dumbos. Do not expect them to do a fact check or any kind of intelligent work.”

g7agg0,https://i.redd.it/4ifcexlrbsu41.jpg,Mango season is coming ! (enjoy after lockdown),," There are over 1000 varieties of mangoes in India. Less than 20 are grown commercially. The World's 36% of mangoes are produced in India [18 million tonnes]. Second, on the list, China only produces 4 million tonnes.

Despite being the highest producer in the world, the share of Indian mangoes in global mango trade is less than 3% - that too in the canned form. The share of fresh mangoes exports is negligible for India. 

Anyway, that means more fruit for us at home. At home, UP produces 23% of all Indian mangoes, AP produces 22% and Karnataka produces 11% - so those 3 states produce over 50% of all mangoes. 

Here is some quick profile of mango varieties so that you can know the mango you eat next time by its name.

Alphonso: Called as Badami in Karnataka and Happus in Maharashtra, Alphonsos are called the king of mangoes. 

Totapuri: The fruit size is medium to large, its shape is oblong with necked base and colour is golden yellow. It is widely used for processing.

Banganapalli: Also known as Safeda, it is a commercial variety of Andhra and Tamil Nadu. 

Dasheri: This variety derives its name from the village Dashehari near Lucknow. Tastes rich and sweet.

Himsagar: This variety is indigenous to Bengal. This is one of the choicest varieties of Bengal and has gained extensive popularity. 

Kesar: This is an expensive variety of Gujarat with a red blush on the shoulders. One of the most expensive ones. Fruit size is medium, shape oblong and keeping quality is good. 

Langra: This variety is indigenous to Varanasi area of Uttar Pradesh. Legend says the mother tree still lives today in a village in UP. The house belongs to a person who is mobility impaired - hence the name.

Ambika: This is a variety developed from a cross between Amrapali and Janardan Pasand and released in the year 2000 for commercial cultivation.  

Mulgoa : This is a commercial variety of south India. It is quite popular among the lovers of mango owing to the high quality of its fruit.

Vanraj: It is a highly prized variety of Vadodra district of Gujarat and fetches good returns. The fruit is medium in size, ovate-oblong in shape and colour is deep chrome.

Suvernarekha: This is a commercial variety of Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. 

Chausa : This variety originated as a chance seedling in the orchard of a Talukdar of Sandila district Hardoi, U.P. Langra is the best. Who Team Langda here?

Also, always thought that Alphonso was overrated. Smells incredible - easily the most ""mango"" smell of all mangoes. But doesn't taste nearly as good","Mango season is coming !

g7awra,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g7awra/my_experience_attending_a_protest_for_the_first/,My experience attending a protest for the first time as a 17 y/o:,"This was written by me a day after the protest, so the timeline will be referred to that way.

Yesterday, for the first time ever, I took part in a protest. A protest which would open my eyes and show me our country like I had never seen before. Despite having a general fear of being in a large crowd and being surrounded by people, I, for the first time ever, felt safe being in the middle of a literal ocean of people. I felt powerful; not in the sense that I alone had the power to influence, but in the sense that my presence contributed to OUR power to influence. Walking into the protest, I expected a lot of pushing and punching but to my surprise, I was not touched a single time. I had a better experience being in a crowd at a protest than I did being in a crowd at the Tirupati darshan. Despite the sheer volume of people present (over 1 lakh) the crowd was the most organized I had ever seen. Then I realised that there was only one thing that separated this crowd from any other crowd: lack of a selfish motive. Every person present did not come for their own personal gain, but for the gain of the country. Be it a crowd at a darshan or a crowd at a bazaar, everyone is there for their own personal benefit. Even at the school assembly, everyone seeks that one extra minute to complete their homework, one extra minute to form their lines, one extra minute to talk to their friends, all for personal gain; which makes the crowd at the assembly seem un-organized. But at this protest, the people represented the common voice on the streets, not themselves. No one expected to have gained anything at the end of the night. Which is what makes a protest so special. 

On the sight of me, my sister and my mom, a few protesters gave us a word of thanks for attending. They were happy to see Hindus taking part too. That made realise that despite this being a Muslim majority protest, it was not about the Muslims. It was not about fighting the government for being excluded. It was not about religion at all. It was, rather, about the absence of religion. About treating everyone as if religion didn't exist. It was not about fighting the government to be included in the list, it was about removing the list altogether. We were fighting for the up-keeing of the Constitution. A Constitution the ruling party does not seem to respect. Throughout our childhood in India, we were taught to look at religion and treat religions with respect. The problem didn't start when we were told to respect other religions, but when we were told to look at religion in the first place. Today when we read a name, the first thing we see is a religion. Lakshmi means Hindu, Ali means Muslim, John means Christian. I myself am guilty of this too but today, the protest showed me that despite religion being deep-rooted in our culture, we can learn to look past it.

A fact: public lunching has more than doubled since 2014, that is, since the BJP came to power. The victims of most of these lynchings were innocent Muslims. These murders have been left unresolved after the government refused to do anything about it. Mob lynchers have even credited Modi as their reason for feeling ""empowered"". Any voice of dissent against the government would be silenced by these lynchers. Today, these voices cannot be silenced. They cannot be killed. It's far too late for that. Finally, the government has received it's most worthy opposition: it's own people. A government which does not respect it's criticism is no government at all. The government is still trying to silence dissent in it's controlled states. UP, Karnataka and Delhi are facing the brunt of this; signs of fear in the ruling party. But every act to silence only raises more voices. And the unity of these voices creates waves; waves which make a difference.

That day I learnt the true meaning of unity in diversity. I learnt what India stands for. I learnt how powerful a protest really is. I learnt the power of unity. And no, Unity is not a 3000 crore statue. As we marched, we saw and heard slogans and chants, some abusing the government and some stating the objective, but there was one chant which stuck with me and kept me thinking about the state of our country: Hindu Muslim Sikh Isai, bhai bhai bhai bhai.

Jai Hind 🇮🇳"," Youths like you are national treasure You are so fortunate to have such an experience.

I also participated in a CAA-NRC protest held in our campus (it was IISc Bangalore, for reference). Well, my experience wasn't as pleasant as yours.

The speeches made by a few people before the protest march started were really good. They were about the purpose of the march being to break the dichotomy of the ""good Science students"" and the ""anti-national Humanities students"" and to express solidarity. A lot of good stuff which I don't remember now.

The march started well. All of us were shouting slogans in unison. You know, all those slogans against the government and the Sanghis etc. Suddenly someone shouts ""Laal Salaam"", and most others follwed him (or her)! I didn't speak anything but kept walking awakardly with the rest of the crowd. I still shouted other slogans along with everyone. However, that wasn't all! After some moments, some people starts shouting slogans against Communism! It all felt an annoying distraction from the purpose of the march. I also came to know later that there were some people in the march who didn't belong to the campus.

That was the first protest march that I participated in and it didn't leave a good impression on me, sadly. I may particpate again in any other protest in the future, hoping to change my opinion.

Interestingly, some days later, I saw in the news that the IIT-B director had issued some rules regarding how ""anti-national activities"" were prohibited, as they would hurt the reputation of their institute which runs on the taxpayers' money.

Around the same time, our director also sent everyone an e-mail, telling us that freedom is important for developing scientific temper and conducting research. So, our director had decided to allow protests, provided that the administartion was informed earlier and only members of the campus participated in the protests, and that the protests were done peacefully.

This made me happy that despite all that happened in the protest earlier, he didn't prohibit protests like in IIT-B. It strengthened my opinion somewhat that IISC Bangalore is the ""JNU among Science Institutes"".

Note: This post is for discussion. If you have nothing but belligerent responses that add nothing to the conversation I will report you. If you only have worn out, down over a thousand times arguments of being caste blind, having merit and anti reservation nonsense, I will be ignoring you. 

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, lets talk.

The anti muslim sentiment grows stronger even in lockdown, with the hindu right finding more ways to demonize muslims everyday. I didnt think it could be possible, but every day it seems they have a new angle of attack. 

And such it has been since day 1 i.e. the day the 2014 elections results came out when the muslim techie was murdered by a hindu mob and that mosque attack happened, I'm forgetting where. The very day of the results. Modi hadnt even taken up PMship that day. 

So to begin, Anti-Muslim rhetoric creates a unified Hindu identity. This is something that BJP has long worked for and was one of the goals of VHP, HM and RSS since their inception - create a Hindu identity that trumps caste indentity so that the caste status quo is maintained while killing any caste discourse. 

Now, I'm muslim. And I have no intention of blaming Dalits for the victory of BJP. Dalits, much like Muslims, have been promised much by politicians purporting to be their champions but delivery has been less than spectacular. Lalu's first term & Maywati's first full term withstanding, no government has been able to delivery upon their promises to their dalit and obc voter very much. So yes, I do not blame these communities for voting outside their 'champions', for 'fracturing' the community vote. 

But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

But coming to the matter at hand, OBC representation in Parliament has been dropping and sarvana i.e. upper caste repesentation is increasing. Now, Dalits have reserved seats so while their count can not decrease, but this seat reservation is working against them. I'm going to copy paste directly from an article here to explain this

[Not a single constituency in India has more than 50 per cent Dalit population, which means it’s always the non-Dalits who decide the fate of Dalit candidates in reserved constituencies. A vocal or assertive Dalit leader has the least chance of winning from such seats. To be re-elected, a Dalit MP must be careful not to antagonise the non-Dalits, and one way of ensuring this is by remaining silent in Parliament.](https://theprint.in/opinion/17th-lok-sabha-looks-set-to-confirm-ambedkars-fears-no-vocal-dalits-in-parliament/232383/)

Note that Balasaheb knew this would happen. Which is why he proposed that non dalits not be given a vote on reserved seats. I am very much with him on this.

So who is the loser here? Mayawati has lost her base. There can be no doubt about it. The BSP+SP combine failed because SP votes were transfered to BSP but the BSP vote was not. Why? Because Dalits find BJP a more attractive proposition than BSP.  Who else? Lalu and Mulayam have lost a significant base altho this could be attributed to multiple reasons. It is also less significant because OBC leaders are many. Dalit leaders are few. 

While Chandrashekar 'Raavan' Azad has made a great big splash, he is being kept under hold by the government almost since day 1. He has the appeal to be a mass leader and present a large potential threat to the status quo. But he has been muzzled and jailed as often as was possible. 

Ultimately even the news cycles focus on muslim, and the caste conflicts happeneing everyday take a backseat, all the while forgetting that 85% of Indian Muslims are lower caste muslims. Here too, the muslim identity has trumped the caste identity and they are doubly the losers here considering that most muslim victim to Islamaphobic attack tend to be the under privileged and of backward caste.

This is all by design, mind you. The idea here is the same I mentioned earlier. Maintain caste status quo and the cost of caste identity. And its working.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

What exactly are these policies? Real problem is fake news. Most people aren't smart enough to check facts by themselves. I don't agree with the ""government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes"" part. Most of the policies, as already mentioned by others, predate this government. Furthermore, most of them are either pure disaster(DeMo), mismanaged policies with potential(GST), or did very little compared to how hyped up they were(swaccha bharat, ujjawala). MNREGA, beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in UPA era, and were better funded than now.

Poverty literally increased under modi, so did unemployment, and income inequality. I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade, a record only second to china, farmers too, which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan. 

What's getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online. Indian people are gullible, and BJP were quick to capitalise on that. People don't question the policies because they don't see the government as the problem, the media and the IT cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times- Muslims, Congress and Pakistan. 

I should add, if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now, you're wrong. Nobody's enlightened, they just have a bigger enemy for now.  If hypothetically, muslims were removed, the caste system will reach it's former glory in no time.","The real loser in India's errupting Islamaphobia: Caste politics.

Note that Modi himself never speaks about caste. Despite being an OBC he never mentions caste struggles and his own caste related experiences. So his being OBC does not bring more visibility to the problems of the oppressed castes.

Edit: More than one commenter has said that it is false that the government schemes have benefitted backward castes very much. I do not have any proof for or against this claim. I am not an expert and am only summarizing what I've been reading from multiple news sources to date.  I understand everything you say except 

> But the fact remains that Modi's government has done spectacular work for the backward communities (barring muslims). We in urban areas scoff at the Modi governments but their work for the financially weak and socially disadvantaged has been phenomenal. From being called ""Congress + Cow"" it has been jokingly called ""Prakash Karat + Cow"". Such is the success of Modi's socialist policies that I have to begrudgingly accept it as the unequivocal truth.

What exactly are these policies? Real problem is fake news. Most people aren't smart enough to check facts by themselves. I don't agree with the ""government uplifting backward classes and hence getting the votes"" part. Most of the policies, as already mentioned by others, predate this government. Furthermore, most of them are either pure disaster(DeMo), mismanaged policies with potential(GST), or did very little compared to how hyped up they were(swaccha bharat, ujjawala). MNREGA, beti bachao beti padao and the likes existed even in UPA era, and were better funded than now.

Poverty literally increased under modi, so did unemployment, and income inequality. I should remind you that UPA under Manmohan uplifted record number of people after poverty in a decade, a record only second to china, farmers too, which constitute most of the backward people in India did far better under Manmohan. 

What's getting them vote is organised hatred they spread online. Indian people are gullible, and BJP were quick to capitalise on that. People don't question the policies because they don't see the government as the problem, the media and the IT cell have given people other enemies to blame in trying times- Muslims, Congress and Pakistan. 

I should add, if you think upper castes think any better of the backward ones now, you're wrong. Nobody's enlightened, they just have a bigger enemy for now.  If hypothetically, muslims were removed, the caste system will reach it's former glory in no time.",Politics

I am very frustrated with MagicBricks. This is a throwaway account.

I desperately needed money so I decided the best way would be to sell my shop through MagicBricks.

They say the ad was on hold as per my confirmation. Without photoshoot, content writing, how is the ad suppose to go live?  On the other hand, they say they are now going to run the advertisement/services by the end of the day.  
No interested buyer would be able to visit the shop till lockdown. I replied to their ticket.

They are now claiming that I have utilized their services, which I obviously haven't and couldn't! They now have enabled services. Without any good photos on the ad, there will be hardly any interested buyers Plus no interested buyers will be able to visit my shop due to lockdown. 

I am forced to delay my plan to sell the shop for a few months.  

I do not have much money left with me. It would take a few months for the shop to be sold. I am a small failed businessman, the banks & other entities won't lend me personal loans or any other loan without collateral. I feel I don't have any option anymore other than getting a loan on collateral.

Since I need money urgently, I cannot afford to wait for months. I have to cancel my plan to sell the shop and get a loan on collateral.  


Running ads at this time would be a total waste of money for me.  


If they provided their services earlier and failed, I'd still understand. However, They haven't provided me service and won't refund me. And now after over a month, when I asked about refund, they are going to run ads during the lockdown.

I am not sure if you're entitled to a refund, but your ad should definitely be up. Hope you paid by a credit card, (a good tier one at that). You may request a chargeback, though tbh your case is a little bit weak. I bought something called an ""Omni pack"" for somwhere around Rs 10,000/-.

What would be some good sides to serve with the chicken?  Thank you all for your help!," Try these search terms, they are 4 different types of curry:

1) Kerala style chicken curry  ( a coconut milk preparation)

2) Chicken Kondattam ( a spicy dry kind of curry - my fav) 

3) Pallipalayam chicken ( I haven't got the hang of cooking this one, but it's supposed to be with dry whole spices.) 

4) Kerala style chicken stew (mild white/ yellow color curry with coconut milk and green chilli, not red chilli unlike earlier recipes)

Sides - not very south Indian, but you can try making naans or any type of Indian flatbread. These can be made with whole wheat or all purpose flour. South Indian flat breads are made of rice / rice flour. A typical South Indian one is called Appam. Not sure you would have all the ingredients for that to hand. If you have a pressure cooker, there is a very easy to make, tasty and healthy chicken recipe. My dad used to enjoy this alot with his single malt every evening. 

For 1 KG chicken you will need 2 onions 3 tomatoes and about 2 cups of water. 

* Add 2 tbsp oil or ghee to pressure cooker and heat.
* Add cardmom, cumin seeds, cinnamon, clove, green chilli and fry a little. 
* Once spices are fragnant, add sliced onion and a pinch of salt. Let it fry till golden brown. 
* Add pureed tomatoes, kashmiri red chilli powder, turmeric and salt. 
* Fry till oil/ghee separates. 
* Add chicken, mix it well. Add water and close the pressure cooker. 
* Cook for 2 whistles and let the steam escape before you open. 

* Mix in chicken masala and garam masala and simmer for 10 minutes. 

It is ready. 
This goes very well with brown rice or as it is. 

Sorry there is no coconut in there but it tastes soo good. I'd suggest lookup on YouTube. Mainly it will help you understand many ingredients/spices to visualize and find it on local grocery stores.","Please help this white girl and suggest a good South Indian chicken recipe So I am stuck in my house due to quarantine and I am craving Indian food.

g7edk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g7edk5/indians_who_have_lost_weight_how_did_you_manage/,"Indians who have lost weight, how did you manage the dieting part?","The problem is, I live in a joint family and all of my family members eat food that high in oil and spices. I have to cut down 20 Kgs and as I have been told, dieting is the central aspect of it. I have never cooked before (which I actually regret) but I am really looking forward to learning. I want to cook healthy diet food for myself. Also, is it possible to do meal prep like preparing and storing semi-cooked food for a week? 

Just want some tips on how did you manage it?"," The only thing that works for me is Intermittent Fasting, and eating around 1200 calories. I’m a girl and about 5’7. For me calorie in and calorie out is what works. I only started working out after I lost the weight coz working out makes me hungry and eat more. Water man. It's just crazy how amazing water is. If you struggle with unusual cravings even when you've just had your meal, increase your hydration. It is hypothesised that the ""thirst centre"" and ""hunger centre"" within the hypothalamus are adjacent. So at times, when you're actually thirsty, you start feeling hungry. Therefore, at times, adequate hydration may help you overcome the desire to consume something snackable when you don't need to. 

The reverse worked for me as I tried to lose weight. I replaced small snacks with water. And water based foods are really good too. There's also some zero calorie foods and negative calorie foods, but that's mostly just conjecture. However, sometimes when I'm doing intermittent fasting I'll allow myself a cup of green tea which claims to be zero calories. 

As far as modification is concerned, first and foremost, cut out all accessory food items. Biscuits with tea. Papad with lunch. Don't try stepping out of your comfort zone too fast. You'll just panic that way. Make small decisions that lead to small victories. And yeah, record these victories if you can, they're a great source of motivation.

If you have a medical condition that requires weight loss like hypertension or diabetes, do consult your physician if you decide to supplement your diet with exercise. So I've lost 8 kgs from the start of this year. I did a couple of things. First I Stopped eating all sorts of processed sugars. No sugar in tea coffee no soft drinks and cut down alcohol consumption to 20% of last year. I drink chaach to fulfill my cravings for a cold drink. 

The second thing was I stopped eating junk food. No Regular pizza burger outside. If I feel like eating something I order healthy alternatives to the regular stuff. 

Third I started taking stairs instead of elevators for up to 4th floor. 

That's all. Did nothing special in terms of diet or anything just small changes in lifestyle.","Indians who have lost weight, how did you manage the dieting part? The problem is, I live in a joint family and all of my family members eat food that high in oil and spices. I have to cut down 20 Kgs and as I have been told, dieting is the central aspect of it. I have never cooked before (which I actually regret) but I am really looking forward to learning. I want to cook healthy diet food for myself. Also, is it possible to do meal prep like preparing and storing semi-cooked food for a week? 

Just want some tips on how did you manage it?  The only thing that works for me is Intermittent Fasting, and eating around 1200 calories. I’m a girl and about 5’7. For me calorie in and calorie out is what works. I only started working out after I lost the weight coz working out makes me hungry and eat more. Water man. It's just crazy how amazing water is. If you struggle with unusual cravings even when you've just had your meal, increase your hydration. It is hypothesised that the ""thirst centre"" and ""hunger centre"" within the hypothalamus are adjacent. So at times, when you're actually thirsty, you start feeling hungry. Therefore, at times, adequate hydration may help you overcome the desire to consume something snackable when you don't need to. 

The reverse worked for me as I tried to lose weight. I replaced small snacks with water. And water based foods are really good too. There's also some zero calorie foods and negative calorie foods, but that's mostly just conjecture. However, sometimes when I'm doing intermittent fasting I'll allow myself a cup of green tea which claims to be zero calories. 

As far as modification is concerned, first and foremost, cut out all accessory food items. Biscuits with tea. Papad with lunch. Don't try stepping out of your comfort zone too fast. You'll just panic that way. Make small decisions that lead to small victories. And yeah, record these victories if you can, they're a great source of motivation.

So I've lost 8 kgs from the start of this year. I did a couple of things. First I Stopped eating all sorts of processed sugars.

Does caste still exist in India? Do people still know their caste or has it completely died out?  Very much intact. I know a girl from UP who was threatened with honor killing and other emotional blackmail when she wanted to marry a lower caste guy. And she said that it happened to her female cousin as well. Honor killings of lower caste men, and upper caste women who fall in love with lower caste men still keep happening. I know more inter caste couples among my friends where parents disapprove.

https://preview.redd.it/cjt1cicmiqu41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e226c05d68c73b5d28faccd0aa46ada0cd138105

### Tl;dr

Since remote work, online education, telemedicine, and reliance on e-retail becomes critical for the foreseeable future there is a need for authorities to take specific action. IFF has written to the DoT and TRAI suggesting that these interventions must look toward overcoming the digital divide, appreciating the importance of the internet and mobile services as an essential utility, and protect net neutrality. Towards this IFF recommends concerted stakeholder dialogue, evidence based interventions to support network capacity, efforts to use government funds towards providing free access to internet services to underprivileged/essential cohorts of people, ensuring all areas have access to high speed internet access and expediting the implementation of a net neutrality enforcement framework.

### Background

The lockdown has seen greater reliance of many segments of the populace on information and communications technologies, in particular the internet. People are using the medium for various purposes such as remotely working from home, distance learning, ordering essential items via e-retail, and telemedicine purposes. More generally, people also use it to stay in touch with their friends, family and loved ones, which is crucial to people’s mental health in these trying times.

In various guidances and notifications, telecommunication and internet services have been repeatedly classified by the Ministry of Home Affairs as essential items. In this regard, the importance of internet and telecommunications access has assumed considerable importance during the current public health crisis. It also brings with its own set of policy and regulatory challenges which must be addressed. If unaddressed, we believe there is a risk that the novel coronavirus may exaggerate the digital/technological divide; stress underlying network infrastructure and risk network neutrality.

### Prior Correspondence with the DoT and TRAI

In a letter dated March 18, 2020 IFF previously wrote to the Hon’ble Minister of Communications and copied this to the DoT and TRAI. In it we anticipated that there may be a risk of undue pressure on underlying internet and mobile networks due to shifts and likely increases in network usage. Therefore we suggested authorities:

1. Conduct periodic reviews of telecom infrastructure in consultation with telecom and internet service providers, content providers, startups and consumer facing organisations. Here, we stressed on the importance of preserving principles of net neutrality.
2. Encourage voluntary pledges by telecom companies towards not terminating people’s connections, due to an inability to pay their bills.
3. Urged the Central Government to issue an advisory that States and Union Territories should not issue internet suspension or restriction orders under the Telecommunications Suspension Rules, 2017.

### So Why Are We Writing This Time?

This is because there are new threats which are emerging, since the commencement of our over month long national lockdown.

### 1. Threat to Net Neutrality

In a letter dated March 21, 2020 the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) wrote to TRAI requesting for clearance of charges for voice and data for certain websites and telephone numbers. Additionally, an Economic Times [**report** ](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/telecom/telecom-news/telcos-suggest-free-access-to-critical-sites/articleshow/74784534.cms?from=mdr)suggested concessions to zero rate certain essential websites pertaining to government services, ecommerce and digital payments applications like the BHIM app, without being charged for data during the lockdown period.

To be sure, TRAI’s Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016, which ostensibly prohibits zero rating of data tariffs in India does allow for exemptions. However, we must consider such developments along with the fact that COAI has also written to online video content providers, to reduce their bitrates to alleviate stress on underlying network infrastructure. By referencing measures taken by online content providers in jurisdictions like Europe, we have noticed that most participants in the Indian market have complied and reduced their offerings to SD bitrates.

These measures have been taken by industry and have been taken with little evidence available to the public of the actual stress being placed on India’s underlying networks, owing to the national lockdown being excessive. India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as underutilised, and therefore even according to existing capacities should be able to handle a 20 percent surge in network traffic. This fact may be contrasted with reports which found that mobile internet use (India’s wireline subscriber base remains very less) only increased by 10 percent in the month of March 2020. Pertinently, in Tier 1 metros the increase was even more modest at 3-5 percent.

Thus, it may be concluded that without appropriate review and response mechanisms, there is a threat to India’s net neutrality regime. As such net neutrality in India remains imperfect owing to the fact that we are yet to finalise a definition of what falls under reasonable traffic management practices, and actual means of monitoring and enforcement. This lacuna in the framework has meant internet access providers in India can avoid compliance net neutrality obligations, under licensing conditions, with relative impunity. We have previously [**written to the government about these concerns in March and May, 2019 respectively**](https://internetfreedom.in/net-neutrality-in-india-needs-to-find-its-bearings/).

### 2. Risk of the Digital and Technological Divide

It is reasonable to conclude that the pandemic is sure to hit those working in informal sectors and marginalised communities at large the hardest.

A recent report on [**The Print**](https://theprint.in/india/education/no-gadgets-no-studies-what-online-classes-mean-for-16-lakh-poor-students-in-delhi-schools/406837/) and an article by Mr [**Osama Manzar (Digital Empowerment Foundation, Founding Director)**](https://www.apc.org/en/blog/def-we-need-free-talk-time-and-internet-during-covid-19) are instructive in this regard. The Print article discusses how the coronavirus is shifting students to distant learning situations reliant on online/IVR based classes/educational setups. This means that in areas like Delhi, students from underprivileged backgrounds are at a distinct disadvantage owing to a lack of digital literacy, no availability of supporting equipment in the household like laptops and smartphones, chargers, and no access to high speed internet connections.

Similarly, Mr Manzar’s article also communicates that aside from internet access, many people from informal/marginalised backgrounds do not even have access to basic mobile connections as well. He illustrates this with the recent exodus from urban to rural areas after the announcement of the national lockdown. In it many people travelled in groups-- to the detriment of social distancing protocols.  This is because the availability of phones with talk time to make calls, was often restricted to one or two persons in large groups. And in such times of hardship, the ability to make a timely phone call to a friend or family member can be a question of life and death.

### IFF’s Recommendations

Keeping the above considerations in mind we urged the Ministry of Communications, DoT and TRAI to collectively consider the following interventions:

1. **Regular Review and Reports on Impact of  COVID-19 on Internet Capacity**: India should have twice a week meetings between DoT, TRAI, TSPs/ISPs, internet exchange points, CDN providers, cloud service providers, content providers, small businesses, video conferencing app developers, consumer groups and so on, to ascertain the actual impact COVID-19 is having on internet capacity and quality of service. The findings from these meetings along with support evidence should be published for the public at large. This will be analogous to the approach adopted by European authorities like BEREC.
2. **Consider Means to Expand Telecom Infrastructure Capacity:** Although India’s internet infrastructure has traditionally been characterised as under utilised, Indian authorities must be alive to the possibility that there may be a need to consider means through which it can ease network maintenance and deployment of internet access services. India must consider steps in this regard. For instance, it may consider discussions with TSPs to maintain an open dialogue on the need to expand network capacity, upgrading network equipment, capacity expansions of base stations in mobile networks, etc. It should also consider the need to free up access to particular airwaves to ensure networks are up and running in an interference free manner.
3. **Expedite Final Recommendations and Implementation of TRAI’s Net Neutrality Consultation:** Considering advances being made by internet access providers which seek exceptions to the net neutrality frameworks, it becomes even more imperative that India expedites its finalisation of its definition for reasonable traffic management practices. At the same time there is a need for more robust monitoring, enforcement and institutions. Therefore, it becomes necessary for authorities to conclude its findings on the latest TRAI [**consultation**](https://main.trai.gov.in/consultation-paper-traffic-management-practices-tmps-and-multi-stakeholder-body-net-neutrality) on traffic management practices and a multistakeholder body for net neutrality.
4. **Consider Means for Free Wi-Fi Hotspots, Access to Laptops/Smartphones and 4G Router Availability:** We have urged DoT and TRAI to consider commencing an initiative which deploys funds available under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF). Along these lines, we also recommend they consider possibilities of working with the Ministry of Home Affairs and state governments to gauge availability of funds under the National Disaster Relief Fund and State Disaster Response Funds. These funds should be used toward facilitating public wi-fi hotspots, 4G routers, internet devices and so on, in particular targeting benefiting students from underprivileged backgrounds, informal workers, healthcare workers, first responders, and people from marginalised communities. 
5. **Urge industry to not disconnect people’s internet/mobile services, and provide free data during lockdown period:** Indian authorities and access service providers should identify vulnerable groups who would benefit from such targeted interventions, which help with the response but also help bridge the digital divide. We would also suggest TRAI and DoT work together with access providers in ensuring that people can have uninterrupted access to their internet and mobile services even if they fall behind on their payments or recharge schedules. Under utilised funds in USOF may be a useful tool in this regard as well.
6. **Urge States and UTs to Maintain Access Full Speed Mobile and Internet Connectivity During Lockdown:** We urged central authorities to consider ways to limit government powers to issue directives which throttle the internet. Therefore, we recommended the issuance of an advisory which urges states to not issue any directions which suspend internet access or impose restrictions on accessing high speed internet.

I was planning to buy a decent mid-premium laptop anything below Rs. 1.3 Lakhs.

I'm not a hardcore gamer, so not looking for a fancy graphic card, but anything that fits casual gaming (mostly CS GO) should be alright.

I plan to use it to learn Python and R. I would also love to experience other Linux based systems (either through VMware or dual boot)

Other than that, most of my time will be spent on  viewing movies and web-browsing (which any standard laptop can do)

Accordingly I believe the following specifications would be good

Intel i7 10th Gen processor
16 GB RAM
512GB /1TB SSD or 1TB HDD with 128 GB SSD
A decent display (4K would be ideal but not mandatory)
Light-weight and preferably touch screen (2-in-1s)
A decent audio setup


Would love your recommendations.
Also if you've purchased a laptop within this price range, and have any suggestions, I would love to hear them out.

Thanks."," Apple Macbook Pro/ Lenovo ThinkPad Carbon X1/ Dell XPS An Inspiron or a surfacebook I'm just gonna advice you that you should make getting a 4k screen the priority.

Success in a state doesn't guarantee that it would work in all the state.
I would have said improvise. Everyone is new to this, learn from other's mistake and for once stop thinking about religion or any political part. Unfortunately its never a clean choice like that. Sure, between the two - a choice that will never be given to anyone in practice - the kerala model is better for overall betterment of the society.

But in practice, the Kerala model evolved thanks to a lot of factors: Social movements against caste and for equality, enlightened kings, international sea trade, little interference by the British, lack of invasions like in North, missionaries with their focus on education, competition by the kings and other religions in education as well as healthcare... All of which led to a strong awareness of rights learned from the Left which even influenced the Congress, a good dose of capitalism when it comes to investment in education and healthcare, the opening of the Gulf and later other countries to skilled and unskilled malayalees who send money back and so on. Land reforms were another.

It also has its negatives when it comes to the left's inability to be a constructive opposition, too many strikes and hartals, and an earlier strong opposition to capitalism which they have mostly abandoned.

Gujarat does not have any of those advantages but what it has is a good number of highly entrepreneurial people (who have over time because very strongly communal), a huge tribal population that has not benefited and which proponents of the Gujarat model actively try to ignore or downplay...

Most states of India are not in a position to adopt either model. But they can pick and choose and try to implement some parts.

Goa where I live now is a different example. Little state, but without the massive social reform movements etc but with the influence of Portuguese, and thanks to tourism from the hippie days, an openness to the world. However, the lack of deliberate social reform movements still has a strong impact, which is easily visible among a minority of the population as strong hostility to other communities, hostility to tourism, to any outsiders and despite the comfort with western attire and skin show, an inability to think of people unlike them as their equals.

And here's my amateur attempt at summarizing the problem:
1. Onions can be harvested only in a few regions, and during a few months of the year. 
2. Every year the harvests cause a glut because everyone sells at the same time. 
3. Unseasonal rains and droughts caused by climate change destroy crops and cause a supply disruption.
4. The destruction of crops, coupled with the lack of storage facilities and unscrupulous middlemen hoarding the crops, leads to a price rise in the later months of the year. 
5. The Government responds by importing onions from Turkey, Pakistan, Bangladesh etc. These onions reach the country after a delay of a few months, and thus depress prices further when the new crop harvests come in for the farmers. 
6. The cycle continues. Farmers have to throw away the produce because of a lack of takers and no storage facilities, middlemen buy up lots of onions to sell at a later date when prices are higher and the story repeats from point 1 to 6 every year. Champani gangs bought all onions directly from farmers for 5 rupees per kg.

They created an artificial shortage of onions by hoarding it.

Onion price rose to 150 rupees per kg.

Other traders got greedy, they bought onions at 150 per kg and started hoarding it thinking, they will sell it for 500 rupees per kg.

There were protest against onion price rise

Champani gang sold their onion at market price and emptied their stocks, made 30 times their investment

Jumlabaaz gang issued an order, making stocking more than 80 kg onion is illegal, they beat few traders who bought onions at 150 rupees and thought, they would make good profit.

At the end, farmers lose money, other traders lose money and champani gang mints HUGE profit, they pass a percentage of the profit to Jumlabaaz gang by buying election bonds.","What Are your thoughts Indian Onion Price Issue? Hi guys I’m from Singapore and I’m doing economic

“Single  source members  gathered on Malegaon, Maharashtra bridge to offer  prayer. When police  went there to remove them they started attacking  policemen.

Maharashtra govt is unable to  enforce lockdown so  now this is the best time for them to call army for  areas like this but  wait how come they can call when Bollywoodias are  praising our CM as  world’s best CM.. so calling Army will question his  governance right  (sic),” the claim shared with the video reads.

Few days later he is then attacked by goons. Though why two bikers with bottles would try to hurt a Y-security person still remains a mystery. And it's no big deal for BJP to hire Congress goons, ample evidence of it during 2002...

Is it a signal that he has served his purpose and now can be done away with..?
Or has he mistakenly questioned his masters (remember how a while ago godi-media was asking questions to BJP which left them fuming) and the masters want to set an example for everyone by mock-atracking him...
Has he asked too much of a price, we do know he got a shiny new office right after elections..?
Is he trying to garner sympathy coz Maharashtra CM has said that people who are giving undue communal angle to Palghar lynching will be taken to task..?
Talks of defemation preparation by Congress rattling up his nerves... (Remember how he changed tunes after Zakir Naik sent him ₹500crore notice).
Could there be another connection between these two seemingly-independent incidents..?

What say Indians..?


P.s. I don't mean to downplay the attack on one of worst editors ever in the history of Indian media, but still thought of asking.

Top Likely Reasons (as per comments)
1) Diverting attention from the International embarrassment post Kuwaiti fiasco, lest the chinks in armour show up.

2) Combining all allegations against Congress to topple the Maharashtra Govt."," Thoda kam crime patrol dekha karo ._. Idk but now because of him people asking how sonia Gandhi is 4th richest person in the world. How come our income tax department which is under the leadership of BJP not able to detect and criminalise her? I see it entirely differently. He is their chief entertainment clown. So if he's suddenly gotten up to a new act and become the main news himself, it means primedaddy and homemama wanted their monkey armies distracted from some bigger issue. My money's on the arab world backlash and the apology tweet primedaddy was forced to issue, a sign of weakness from one who never says sorry ever and so should not be allowed to dwell in the minds of the monkeys for long. I see the sudden loud overnight communalization of palghar incident too as a consequence of the same distraction tactic.

Whenever the rightwing influencer ecosystem suddenly and unexpectedly shifts focus, I go back to the same question - why do they want their monkeys distracted, and from what?","Has Arnab served his purpose and do his master's deem it fit to get rid of him..? Arnab first quits the Editor's guild, an association of which he didn't even bother attending meetings for over a decade.

Few days later he is then attacked by goons. Though why two bikers with bottles would try to hurt a Y-security person still remains a mystery. And it's no big deal for BJP to hire Congress goons, ample evidence of it during 2002...

Is it a signal that he has served his purpose and now can be done away with..?
Or has he mistakenly questioned his masters (remember how a while ago godi-media was asking questions to BJP which left them fuming) and the masters want to set an example for everyone by mock-atracking him...
Has he asked too much of a price, we do know he got a shiny new office right after elections..?
Is he trying to garner sympathy coz Maharashtra CM has said that people who are giving undue communal angle to Palghar lynching will be taken to task..?
Talks of defemation preparation by Congress rattling up his nerves... (Remember how he changed tunes after Zakir Naik sent him ₹500crore notice).
Could there be another connection between these two seemingly-independent incidents..?

What say Indians..?


P.s. I don't mean to downplay the attack on one of worst editors ever in the history of Indian media, but still thought of asking.

Top Likely Reasons (as per comments)
1) Diverting attention from the International embarrassment post Kuwaiti fiasco, lest the chinks in armour show up.

2) Combining all allegations against Congress to topple the Maharashtra Govt.  Thoda kam crime patrol dekha karo ._. Idk but now because of him people asking how sonia Gandhi is 4th richest person in the world. How come our income tax department which is under the leadership of BJP not able to detect and criminalise her? I see it entirely differently. He is their chief entertainment clown. So if he's suddenly gotten up to a new act and become the main news himself, it means primedaddy and homemama wanted their monkey armies distracted from some bigger issue. My money's on the arab world backlash and the apology tweet primedaddy was forced to issue, a sign of weakness from one who never says sorry ever and so should not be allowed to dwell in the minds of the monkeys for long. I see the sudden loud overnight communalization of palghar incident too as a consequence of the same distraction tactic.

My mom's college has not paid this month's salary yet, to any of the employee. From teachers, to peons and guards. 

Now it's one thing to not give salary to senior staff for whatever reason but for low salaried workers like peons and guards, they might already be going through hell because of lockdown. Not recieving their salary will be a big punch in their gut. 

Can they do this? Didn't the government instructed organizations to not cut salary or lay off employees? Was it just some recommendation or is there a law and people can take action if someone doesn't follow it? 

I'm not mentioning the name of the college (yet) until I have some direction to think. It's a private one in Indore.

My mom is senior teacher and we're only worried about the low wage workers at the moment. She told me that talking to the college authorities will be a waste of time because they are really toxic and don't entertain these talks.

Please suggest me something.

Edit: One more clarification - Teachers here are still working full-time. My mom has to take lectures, report back with student attendence, and other duties. I forgot to mention it earlier.

And about funds, as you might know, colleges collect fee in advance. This semester was already paid off by students."," >Didn't the government instructed organizations to not cut salary or lay off employee

No, Govt  ""asked"" the orgs not to lay off or cut the salaries .

Thing  is , every thing runs on money. If money flow stops , every thing falls apart.

Even the schools and colleges need to run on money. Money paid by students as tution fee and donation .

There is no otherway to supplement the lack of funding.

>they might already be going through hell because of lockdown.

Thats the sad reality . They have little to survive . How will one save money for these .

>She told me that talking to the college authorities will be a waste of time because they are really toxic and don't entertain these talks.

When ran out of money , these organizations dont know what to do. All the queries will be about money so they dont entertain the talks.


This should ease a bit by end of may. But there is a whole fn month to go through. 

Try to arrange groceries for them to survive through this . Pray that they dont run into emergencies. Upvoting for visibility. 

This is happening in few other colleges too. Institutions runs on advance fee payments from students, there is very little excuse for them to do something like this. 

I assume teachers are still working full time? Taking online classes of students and reporting back to the admins, etc? It's a question of who blinks first.
Sadly there is nothing much you can do.

(1) What programming languages you know ? 

What did you use it for - web dev / freelancing / any other ? 

(2) How did you learn coding skills ? 

Was it -

a) Youtube ? If Yes, which youtubers helped you in learning ?

b) Coding bootcamps ? Can you suggest a good one in India ?

c) Online courses ? If Yes, among free/paid ones - which one would you recommend ?

d) Blogs ? Discord/Telegram Coding Communities ? Which one would you recommend ?

e) Competitive coding platforms like HackerRank ?"," Not sure if I would call myself as a hobbyist coder since I studied CS in college and work as a programmer, I used to do a lot of android back in college but now I'm really big on php, laravel, a bit of R and python and possess some superficial level of knowledge on C and C++ from what I learnt back in college and school. I've tried a variation of most of the options here, the best thing that worked out for me is to just use the official documentation for whatever language / tool that you want to learn and see what they recommend an example is if you want to learn vue js then just study their entire documentation and try out all the examples and then try a sample project that you've wanted to do, if you don't know what project you want to implement them search for good project ideas online on medium or GitHub or reddit or wherever, some tech like android have their own offical course by googlers themselves and from what I remember they really were good so it really depends on each of the tech but the official one is the best, there might be some cases where the official documentation sucks in which case you have to start thinking if whether the language/tool/tech you are learning really is a good one because usually most good tech has good documentation and a lot of people contributing to it except in really really rare cases.

Once you know the language the next thing you would probably want to do is how to write the code in a neater way, I personally would recommend books on writing clean code (Clean Code is a personal favourite of mine) and then read books on design patterns (take this in slowly because I ended up reading them too quickly the first time without even understanding this properly and fucked up my code big time on a project and I'm still paying for the flaws I've made) and watch videos of the conferences that these tech holds, it helps you be updated and see what the top guys of these tech are upto and what they recommend.

As for competitive programming, it really depends on what your end goal is, I usually get this occasional itch where I don't want to develop something but I just want to program during these times I just log onto a competitive programming site and then just pick a random problem and then try to solve it and end up learning a data structure or algorithm technique, if you want to get good at this then many of the competitive programming websites have a lot of tutorials and stuff I would recommend the book (How to solve it by computing) as a fairly simpler introduction to competitive programming and algorithms if the resources online are overwhelming. Some good competitive programming websites would be topcoder, codeforces (where the really top and over enthusiastic guys hang around) these people are really hardcore and solve a lot of problems and they have an excellent problem set for you to solve it, then we have hackerrank and codechef which attracts a lot of Indian crown so if you want to talk to people from your own country for some reason you could try here, there are other lesser known ones you could try atcoder, project Euler, spoj etc which you can check out, I would recommend selecting the websites that you like and then going from there but unless your job is going to be heavily dependent on data structures or algorithm level problems I'm not too sure if they would be useful in your day to day job (they help you get through your interviews easily though) but it's still fun to learn. Totally hobbyist coder, transitioning in to a freelancer. Coding languages I know? Python, C and JavaScript. For most of the things I wanna do, these three are more than enough!

I learnt it by reading books, just how everyone does it. (1) Java - as part of my internship
      Python - hobby projects
      C and C++ - college projects
(2) (a) youtube definitely helped. But I don't have any specific youtubers to suggest. But some needs special mentions : the coding train, back to back swe, cs dojo, Tushar Roy
      (b) not sure
      (c) not courses but have solved tons of algo and data structures questions from g4g and leetcode. For courses I have followed Udemy 
     (d) some of them are my own college related. Peer coding group helps a lot.
    (e) haven't done competitive programming. Never got time

d) Blogs ? Discord/Telegram Coding Communities ? Which one would you recommend ?

e) Competitive coding platforms like HackerRank ?  Not sure if I would call myself as a hobbyist coder since I studied CS in college and work as a programmer, I used to do a lot of android back in college but now I'm really big on php, laravel, a bit of R and python and possess some superficial level of knowledge on C and C++ from what I learnt back in college and school. I've tried a variation of most of the options here, the best thing that worked out for me is to just use the official documentation for whatever language / tool that you want to learn and see what they recommend an example is if you want to learn vue js then just study their entire documentation and try out all the examples and then try a sample project that you've wanted to do, if you don't know what project you want to implement them search for good project ideas online on medium or GitHub or reddit or wherever, some tech like android have their own offical course by googlers themselves and from what I remember they really were good so it really depends on each of the tech but the official one is the best, there might be some cases where the official documentation sucks in which case you have to start thinking if whether the language/tool/tech you are learning really is a good one because usually most good tech has good documentation and a lot of people contributing to it except in really really rare cases.

Once you know the language the next thing you would probably want to do is how to write the code in a neater way, I personally would recommend books on writing clean code (Clean Code is a personal favourite of mine) and then read books on design patterns (take this in slowly because I ended up reading them too quickly the first time without even understanding this properly and fucked up my code big time on a project and I'm still paying for the flaws I've made) and watch videos of the conferences that these tech holds, it helps you be updated and see what the top guys of these tech are upto and what they recommend.

As for competitive programming, it really depends on what your end goal is, I usually get this occasional itch where I don't want to develop something but I just want to program during these times I just log onto a competitive programming site and then just pick a random problem and then try to solve it and end up learning a data structure or algorithm technique, if you want to get good at this then many of the competitive programming websites have a lot of tutorials and stuff I would recommend the book (How to solve it by computing) as a fairly simpler introduction to competitive programming and algorithms if the resources online are overwhelming. Some good competitive programming websites would be topcoder, codeforces (where the really top and over enthusiastic guys hang around) these people are really hardcore and solve a lot of problems and they have an excellent problem set for you to solve it, then we have hackerrank and codechef which attracts a lot of Indian crown so if you want to talk to people from your own country for some reason you could try here, there are other lesser known ones you could try atcoder, project Euler, spoj etc which you can check out, I would recommend selecting the websites that you like and then going from there but unless your job is going to be heavily dependent on data structures or algorithm level problems I'm not too sure if they would be useful in your day to day job (they help you get through your interviews easily though) but it's still fun to learn. Totally hobbyist coder, transitioning in to a freelancer. Coding languages I know? Python, C and JavaScript. For most of the things I wanna do, these three are more than enough!

I learnt it by reading books, just how everyone does it. (1) Java - as part of my internship
      Python - hobby projects
      C and C++ - college projects
(2) (a) youtube definitely helped. But I don't have any specific youtubers to suggest. But some needs special mentions : the coding train, back to back swe, cs dojo, Tushar Roy
      (b) not sure
      (c) not courses but have solved tons of algo and data structures questions from g4g and leetcode. For courses I have followed Udemy 
     (d) some of them are my own college related. Peer coding group helps a lot.
    (e) haven't done competitive programming. Never got time
It was always doing some personal projects vs competitive programming . Chose personal hobby projects. Have solved problems from Hackerrank. Definitely helps.",AskIndia

In simple words stray dogs are pests that threaten humans and should be dealt with the most humane way possible I also don't support mass killing but people who think there is no problem I hope you get fucking biten.

I think people should report aggressive dogs and they should be killed without any protests through injections.
All females need to be sterilized and all dogs should get vaccinated and stuff so we can decrease chance of rabies.

I’ve always thought that relationships were stupid and I’ve never been in one but she changed my view on that, we started dating in December and things were going great but due to reasons I don’t want to mention we broke up in early March, it’s been almost 2 months now and I think I’m finally over her (this was my first relationship)

g6md1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6md1z/geopolitics_of_bangladesh_liberation_war_why/,Geopolitics of Bangladesh liberation war - Why India initially didn't want East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh) to gain independence from West Pakistan (modern day Pakistan ),"I was researching on this subject recently which revealed some interesting points about the Bangladesh liberation war and the indo Pakistan 1971 war

**1) Indira Gandhi government was of opinion that east Bangladeshi parties coming to power in combined Pakistan assembly would moderate west Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir**

So , I need to give a little background . Before the Bangladesh liberation war really gathered steam , a student protest had already broken our in West and east Pakistan against dictator Ayub Khan . The movement demanded the restoration of democracy in combined Pakistan . When the situation became too hot to handle , the Pakistani military stepped in and deposed Ayub khan . It was decided to hold elections soon .

Now , you need to know that population wise , the population of Bangladeshis in east Pakistan was numerically greater than population of West Pakistan . 

In the elections that followed that , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party Awami league won a landslide victory in East Pakistan . They won almost every seat in East Pakistan (awami league lost only 2 seats ) and emerged as the single largest party in combined Pakistan national assembly.Bhutto and his People's party were the second largest but nowhere near majority.

This was a shock election results for the Pakistani military establishment and Bhutto who had thought that west Pakistani dominance in national assembly was inevitable.

The Indian government found this result as optimistic for India . We thought that the Bengali politicians of East Pakistan would care less about Kashmir and would start an era of better relationship with India . Thus as a result , in the initial days of the liberation movement , India wasn't really keen on an independent Bangladesh as that would mean an even more rabid west Pakistan with regards to Kashmir 

**2) Indira Gandhi government was afraid of leftist elements in Bangladeshi independence movement . She was afraid that once they attain independence , they will give support to the Maoist - naxal insurgency raging in West Bengal**

The cold war geopolitics had caused Pakistan to join the side of capitalist America and the west . 

Meanwhile in India , a Maoist insurgency was raging in West Bengal and East India .

Indira Gandhi and her government was afraid that once Bangaldesh attained independence , the left elements involved in the liberation movement would give refuge and support to the Maoist insurgents in West Bengal ( which was not currently happening since Pakistan was on the American side )

As a result , members of Indira Gandhi government were of opinion that it was better if east Pakistan remained part of Pakistan 

**3) Soviet Union was afraid that an independent Bangladesh would be a Chinese ally**

Before the liberation movement , the sino-soviet split had taken place . The communist world was taking the side of either China or Soviet Union .

Soviet Union was afraid that the Maoist section of the Bangaldesh liberation movement would push them towards the China camp .

As a result , Soviet Union warned India against any drastic action in Bangladesh .

They kept this position until Indira Gandhi herself went to Moscow and held a 5 hour meeting with the top leader to brief them on the ongoing genocide in East Pakistan (operation searchlight ) . She also reminded them of their obligation under Indo-Soviet friendship treaty . It was after this meeting that Soviet Union finally changed their position and sided with India 

**4) America was afraid that break up of Pakistan would derail the ongoing negotiations between China - USA which was being done via Pakistan . As a result Nixon threatened India that any war against Pakistan will be expensive for India**

Good thread OP","Geopolitics of Bangladesh liberation war - Why India initially didn't want East Pakistan (modern Bangladesh) to gain independence from West Pakistan (modern day Pakistan ) I was researching on this subject recently which revealed some interesting points about the Bangladesh liberation war and the indo Pakistan 1971 war

**1) Indira Gandhi government was of opinion that east Bangladeshi parties coming to power in combined Pakistan assembly would moderate west Pakistan's obsession with Kashmir**

So , I need to give a little background . Before the Bangladesh liberation war really gathered steam , a student protest had already broken our in West and east Pakistan against dictator Ayub Khan . The movement demanded the restoration of democracy in combined Pakistan . When the situation became too hot to handle , the Pakistani military stepped in and deposed Ayub khan . It was decided to hold elections soon .

Now , you need to know that population wise , the population of Bangladeshis in east Pakistan was numerically greater than population of West Pakistan . 

In the elections that followed that , Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his party Awami league won a landslide victory in East Pakistan . They won almost every seat in East Pakistan (awami league lost only 2 seats ) and emerged as the single largest party in combined Pakistan national assembly.Bhutto and his People's party were the second largest but nowhere near majority.

This was a shock election results for the Pakistani military establishment and Bhutto who had thought that west Pakistani dominance in national assembly was inevitable.

The Indian government found this result as optimistic for India . We thought that the Bengali politicians of East Pakistan would care less about Kashmir and would start an era of better relationship with India . Thus as a result , in the initial days of the liberation movement , India wasn't really keen on an independent Bangladesh as that would mean an even more rabid west Pakistan with regards to Kashmir 

**2) Indira Gandhi government was afraid of leftist elements in Bangladeshi independence movement . She was afraid that once they attain independence , they will give support to the Maoist - naxal insurgency raging in West Bengal**

The cold war geopolitics had caused Pakistan to join the side of capitalist America and the west . 

Meanwhile in India , a Maoist insurgency was raging in West Bengal and East India .

Indira Gandhi and her government was afraid that once Bangaldesh attained independence , the left elements involved in the liberation movement would give refuge and support to the Maoist insurgents in West Bengal ( which was not currently happening since Pakistan was on the American side )

As a result , members of Indira Gandhi government were of opinion that it was better if east Pakistan remained part of Pakistan 

**3) Soviet Union was afraid that an independent Bangladesh would be a Chinese ally**

Before the liberation movement , the sino-soviet split had taken place . The communist world was taking the side of either China or Soviet Union .

Soviet Union was afraid that the Maoist section of the Bangaldesh liberation movement would push them towards the China camp .

As a result , Soviet Union warned India against any drastic action in Bangladesh .

They kept this position until Indira Gandhi herself went to Moscow and held a 5 hour meeting with the top leader to brief them on the ongoing genocide in East Pakistan (operation searchlight ) . She also reminded them of their obligation under Indo-Soviet friendship treaty . It was after this meeting that Soviet Union finally changed their position and sided with India 

**4) America was afraid that break up of Pakistan would derail the ongoing negotiations between China - USA which was being done via Pakistan . As a result Nixon threatened India that any war against Pakistan will be expensive for India**

The green Revolution hadn't taken place yet . India had a ship to mouth existence where American aid to poor countries like India kept us afloat . America used to send food package and other relief measures to India regularly . 

If America had suspended those relief packages and placed sanctions on us , we would have been in great trouble . On top of those  , if they had placed more sanctions on us , our economic system would have collapsed .

As a result , we had to take any decision seriously.  Thanks for this! Was interesting.

g74qe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g74qe2/rant_the_indian_education_system/,[RANT] The Indian Education System.,"Good Afternoon Fellow Indians!

Today, let us discuss the problems with YOUR education system!

&#x200B;

Now to note, there are 4 key points on which I'd like to keep my utmost focus upon-

1. Non-Skill Based Education.
2. The Indian Parental Mentality.
3. The Rich and the Richer.  







No.1-

Non-skill based education has rendered Indian students hapless. All Indian schools only teach students theoretically and never teach them the applications of their knowledge. Only garnering a degree is not enough for your success.  Any Indian, if you ask them, to do something ***out of the syllabus*** would be unable to do any such task.  Indians are never thought about how to do something in practice. Practicals only come in 11th grade and that too, not often. Indians are also asked to focus only on academics, not on sports and applications and then we wonder why don't we get as many gold medals and Nobel Prizes as other countries do. The sole reason is, Indians know what is a rat, where to buy rat poison and how it affects the rat's body but are never told how to lure the rat, how to place the posion and where to find the place to buy rat poison.

&#x200B;

No.2-

Indian parents think that there are only four occupations in a person's life, Doctor, Engineer, getting an MBA and corporate and/or Government Services. No other occupations are even slightly respected. Even the last two are to be earned only after, IIT and NEET. If any child even dares to ask his parents to be something else, he is given a tight slap and told to prepare for such competitive exams. Why this mentality, parents? This leads to many kids not being able to fulfill their dreams and leads mass competition with people who are not even interested in the occupation while leaving a vast void for other occupations.

&#x200B;

No.3-

The rich are able to donate to private and rich schools and get their children into the school, while the more deserving are left out because of their socio-economic conditions.

&#x200B;

All in all, the problems are many but yet, we, the Indian Youth, can come together and get rid of such problems. I really don't want any hate on this, these are just opinions but if we want India to develop, we have to give these factors a look. 

Disclaimer: I have no hate against any caste, please do not hate on no.1. I just believe it'd be better to give economic and educational aid to the underprivileged instead, of giving them to just a certain amount of people, in which even the 'creamy layer' takes advantage. All in all, you and I have to bring the change.

&#x200B;

Respect.

I'm only 14 so please don't hate me.


Edit: I forgot to mention that, I do not support caste-based reservation but I do like the idea of economic reservation but in a very limited manner that is.



Edit 2: In respect for all of you who have corrected me, I have understood your reasons and removed the reservation aslo, backlash made me remove it.
:D"," 1. Not everyone gets that fair chance. Some SC/STs are really downtrodden and they need help. Even I don't like caste-based reservation. I think reservation should be given to all the downtrodden.

2. Don't just blame the schools, the students are also partly to blame. Yes the syllabus is bad, and yeah we are only told to focus on the syllabus, but when you reach a certain age, you should at least be able to think for yourself. I am an FY Engg. student and I see that most of my classmates are really unmotivated, and barely interested in the coursework. They don't wish to explore the coursework, or take any interest in engineering. Majority of them have zero idea about their branch, and only took it because they were getting a good college/weren't getting CSE in a good college. They are getting a lot more freedom and they use it for wasting their time in chasing girls or TikTok, PUBG,etc.

3. I understand some parents are bad, but most of them just want their child to be happy. Unfortunately they see happiness as getting settled and making money.

4. This why partly why we need 'reservation'. The burden upon us is of building an egalitarian society, by all means necessary. The bar for removing Reservation is extremely high: until crony ends, until caste ceases to be a means of discrimination, until there is proportional representation of all social groups in all walks of life, until birth has no correlation with occupation, until no Dalit name is used as a slur: reservation must remain as a means of ensuring that we don’t end up in a society where 3 castes run the courts, the military and the media. So, ground-interventions are done, NGOs operate, missionaries run schools. 

&#x200B;

Reservation is not a cause of the poor education system: it’s there because no matter how much economic privilege someone gains, their caste name can still be used as a slur, to imply that they are worthless because of their seat, to bully them to the point of suicide and to deny them jobs in many fields because they aren’t well-connected enough or don’t speak English well enough. Change that, and reservation won’t be a problem anymore. > The Reservation System was the brainchild of Dr.B.R. Ambedkar, President of the
Constituent Assembly and one of the greatest leaders India has ever seen. He wanted to pull up the Dalits and wanted them to stand face-to-face with the other categories. Noble idea indeed. But the Reservation System remained a good idea in theory but has been executed immensely poorly in India. Instead of providing special education packages to the bottom 50% of Dalits and untouchables, the Reservation System has destroyed any remaining meaning of merit. The most talented people get rejected due to their caste. I believe that the underprivileged should be provided a special educational package so that, they also yearn to study and become something, instead of barely learning anything and being selected for colleges, as a select few do. I believe that everyone has a right to education and shall only be selected on merit and everyone should have a fair chance. There should only be somewhat relief for the poor and economically fragile. (Note: I do not believe in any whatsoever caste system, all people are equal for me and I believe the underprivileged irrespective of caste should be provided a special educational package allowing them to study for free.)

Looking for unbiased answers. Are you satisfied with what Modi's government is doing? The cases seem to be increasing every day but I'm not that worried because they seem to have increased the testing capacity. 

However, we have been one month in lockdown already and the cases don't seem to be abating anytime soon. The poor are suffering so much due to lockdown. Do you think we will overcome this by June?  Not at all. It's only just started here. So we are in it for a long time. Not satisfied at all, as don't see him having a road or addressing the concerns of the country. By constantly extending the lockdown (pretty sure will get extended again) is not going to help. Will only make it more difficult to get things back to normal. This virus isn't going to go away by June. If we use the 1920 Spanish flu as a base, it will come in waves, with the second wave being the deadliest, the virus having mutated to its optimum; and the third wave the weakest since healthcare systems have already fought the disease twice, and just know what to do. Even if everything goes perfectly, don't expect a vaccine before 2021; by which time the second wave would have already hit us.

g6jggc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6jggc/how_does_herd_immunity_work/,How does herd immunity work?,"Does herd immunity mean that if half the population gets infected, the other half automatically becomes immune?
I am confused."," Trying my best bit to make sense of what I read some time back. 

Before you start with herd immunity you need to understand two things. Herd Threshold and R.zero factor.

Proportion of immune individuals in a sample set of population above which the disease cannot spread. This is defined as ""Herd Threshold"". Herd Threshold is dependent on the size of the population. Greater the population sample greater the number. 

""R.zero"" typical number of infections passed on by an infectious person. A measure of person to person transmission within herd/community.

When a person or a group of persons are part of an immune herd then the probability of spread depends on the Herd Threshold and the R.zero factor. Chances of an infection spread decrease within a community with larger density of immune people. This can protect those without immunity. People who are affected with the infection will be acting as barriers to spreaders. They may carry but won't spread.  In disease elimination this can be achieved to eradicate the infection within the community if appropriate or slightly higher than required threshold can be reached. Herd Immunity is a phenomena seen when a high percentage of individuals within a population have developed immunity to a pathogen. Because so many people within the community are unable to contract the disease or virus, this reduces the likelihood that those who have not developed immunity will contract the disease. 

ELI5 - Imagine there is a nasty virus going around infecting people but 95% of the population is immune.
That means there is a 95% chance of the virus dying and just 5% chance of it infecting someone in the community. As opposed to an 100% infection rate if there is no immunity at all. https://youtu.be/tC47JjakPSA. This video explains it in 1 minute with animation.","How does herd immunity work?

Herd Immunity is a phenomena seen when a high percentage of individuals within a population have developed immunity to a pathogen. Because so many people within the community are unable to contract the disease or virus, this reduces the likelihood that those who have not developed immunity will contract the disease. 

ELI5 - Imagine there is a nasty virus going around infecting people but 95% of the population is immune.
That means there is a 95% chance of the virus dying and just 5% chance of it infecting someone in the community. As opposed to an 100% infection rate if there is no immunity at all. https://youtu.be/tC47JjakPSA. This video explains it in 1 minute with animation.",AskIndia

**Tl;dr**

The National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) has sought to revise its Request for Proposals (RFP) for tender bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) according to an update on its website dated March 23, 2020. IFF has previously called for a three year moratorium on the government use of facial recognition technologies under its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In this instance, we have shared a representation with the NCRB and the Hon’ble Minister of Home Affairs Mr Amit Shah. In it, we highlight legal and constitutional issues with such projects. As a remedy our representation seeks a recall of this RFP and a halt to the tender process itself. It also provides concrete policy recommendations for the Government to consider.   


**Background on AFRS**

The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS), which has an estimated budget of INR 308 crore, to further create a national database of photographs. According to the RFP, this database is purported to be used to swiftly identify criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like:  


1. Passport database under the Ministry of External Affairs,
2. Crime and Criminal Tracking Network and Systems (CCTNS) by the National Crime Records Bureau(NCRB) under the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA),
3. Interoperable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) by the NCRB under the MHA ,
4. Women and Child Development Ministry's KhoyaPaya Portal,
5. Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) by the NCRB under the MHA
6. Any other image database available with police/other entities.  


The NCRB first released the RFP calling for bids for the creation of AFRS on 28 June, 2019 (Document Reference: 02/001). Initially, the deadline for submission of bids was on August 16, 2019 (Read our first post on the subject [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  However, the deadline for submission has been extended six times due to administrative reasons by the NCRB.  According to an [**update**](https://ncrb.gov.in/sites/default/files/tender/AFRS.pdf) dated March 23, 2020 published on the NCRB’s website, the RFP is now being revised. The current deadline for submission is May 22, 2020.  


As pointed out in our previous [**blogpost**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/) on the matter, use of this technology without having legal safeguards in place could lead to harms such as discrimination and exclusion which will be difficult to undo. Additionally, in the absence of a strong data protection law, use of this technology could easily lead to mass surveillance. A strong data protection law is needed to hold AFRS accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties to ensure that there is proportionality in processing the data collected. Proportionality during processing of personal data means that only that personal data which is adequate and relevant for the purposes of the processing is collected and processed.   


**Steps taken by IFF**  


IFF has sought a [**three year moratorium**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-have-written-to-the-government-seeking-a-3-year-moratorium-on-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-india-projectpanoptic/) to be imposed upon all government use of facial recognition technology. IFF has also consistently opposed the use of facial recognition by NCRB since the first report on AFRS came to light. IFF has previously sent a [**legal notice**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) to NCRB seeking that they recall the RFP and halt the tender process since the project lacks a legal basis. IFF would like to thank the NCRB for responding to our previous legal notice and also for their decision to revise the RFP. However, we are of the opinion these steps being taken by the NCRB are insufficient and there is a need for further changes and immediate action.

In this representation, therefore IFF recommends that:  


1. NCRB immediately rollbacks its request for proposals and halts its ongoing tender process for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System.
2. The Government of India place a moratorium of three years on the use of facial recognition technology by government authorities in India during which time an informed consultation takes place between the various stakeholders and civil society organizations to understand the ambit of this technology
3. The Government of India immediately passes a strong data protection law to hold government functionaries accountable when they collect people’s personal data whilst deploying such systems.
4. The Government of India should pass a specific law with regard to facial recognition technology to regulate the technology in the country. This law should be developed as a result of the informed consultation process as mentioned above.  


**What’s Next?**

IFF has been mapping the use of facial recognition all over the country as a part of its ongoing #ProjectPanoptic. In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

In addition to seeking a three year moratorium on the use of this technology, we have been constantly seeking information about these projects all over India and have also been engaging with government authorities whenever the need arises. IFF will be developing and publishing more material as part of our ongoing analysis of this topic under this project in the coming months.

You understand how deeply rooted modi and BJPs idea of hindutva is in our society? And if you look at it from the other side - which other leader has proactively taken up interests of the general hindu population which accounts for over 85% of the votebank. Just look around in your social media - you will find even your own family, friends, colleagues support Modi's idea of India - and these people would be India's most educated people, so you can guess about what less educated ones will  be thinking. 

Modi is here to stay whether we like it or not because the masses want him. The most problematic figure in this image is not the increase but how high the approval rating are. In a democracy the approval rating should be minimally positive so that the government cannot afford leniency in their work.

Mainstream media and social media are really your only friends for any semblance of sympathy and ""justice"".

Further, many of our people, including or especially ""educated"" ones, have a tendency to trust the police and blame victims.

Yogendra Yadav while exiting AAP said he's leaving since amongst other issues, AK is 'Little Modi'. Seems he's a good judge.  Read past the clickbait title, govt didn't issue a gag order:

> The government of Delhi ordered, on Tuesday, state hospitals to take note of the social media messages regarding the functioning of these hospitals to either rebut them or take corrective action to avoid recurrences of such incidents.

One hospital did issue a gag order, but not the govt:

> Immediately after the government order, GTB Hospital director Sunil Kumar sent a gag order to all the health staff on COVID-19 duty.

> At Lok Nayak Hospital, while no order was issued, the medical director called several nurses to explain about their posts about their unhygienic stay and lack of food on social media.

Get out of this rabbit hole and run. You're never going to get to be with her.

Long story short - Katega I don't wanna sound rude but once you express your feelings and she rejects you, then you should not flirt back even when she flirts with you....I think it's disrespectful to yourself in a way (As you mentioned something about showing attitude)

Therefore, it has been decided that tests will be conducted in Gujarat within the limit of 2000 per day.

g6o9rw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g6o9rw/is_democracy_right_for_india/,Is democracy right for India?,"This is just meant to be a ""what-if"" post and nothing to be taken serious. This is to promote a healthy debate.
I in no way support dictatorship, authoritarianism or anything like that. I am very proud of our democratic traditions however flawed they might be, you can't deny they have held well since independence and I hope they stay strong forever. This can be said to be a case study.

So Iets start with China which have a single party authoritative form of government. And if you compare our economies till 1980 things were pretty similar. Similar populations, similar gdp, similar poverty levels etc. But in just 30 years China have literally left us in the dust in matters of economy and there is no denying that. Now, I do think we have done pretty well ourselves but it's not enough considering our huge population. The thing is whatever you say about the lack of freedom in China etc etc. There government get things done. For eg. How they cleaned up Beijing's pollution problem with a good laid out effective plan. That's a huge flaw of democracy. The time it takes to reach a conclusion is often devastatingly slow. Now, ofcourse I think democracy is the better form of government as people get to participate in the decision making process. But here stems the first question,
 
Do you think it's good for a country LIKE India?
Once you reach a certain level of development I think democracy is a better choice but do you think for a country like India or a  third world country, a country that is just corrupt and have many problems. Will democracy be a good choice. I mean I can't name many third world countries that became developed following democratic principles (The West is definitely not developed due to democracy. Yeah colonialism I am looking at you.) I think you need a government which can make decisions quick and effectively. Now the whole problem with this is that if we give power to a single party or person no one gets to question them and they can abuse their power for their own benefit. So it can go two ways, Either you get someone like Mao Zedong (Who is a fucking moron) or a Deng Xiaoping (Who is a fucking legend. Literally pulled China out of the junk.) So the second question is,

If you get a smart dictator (like Deng Xiaoping) will you prefer an authoritarian government?
Now with all this will definitely come a problem of shutting a few mouths and stuff as there will always be opposition to change. So some civil liberties will be naturally be curbed in a government of this type. So the third question is, 

Will you be willing to trade your civil liberties with a guarantee that the regime will make the country developed?

We can see examples of this in the Four Asian Tigers. Let's restrict it to South Korea and Singapore. Singapore had a great dictator in Lee Kuan. He changed a small country's destiny in a few decades. (Deng Xiaoping proved it can be done on a larger scale as well). And then you look at South Asia which isn't doing great at all! We have Sri Lanka with their civil war. Pakistan with their Coup. Nepal which isn't doing well and Bangladesh isn't doing well either. Also South Korea later turned to a democracy and I think they are doing great. So the last question is,

Will you accept an authoritarian government if it will turn to a democracy later when things settle down?
(Though this is rare)

So tell me what you think guys! I just want India to be a country that the world appreciate. Because undoubtedly there is no country in the world that will be as great as India once it is a developed country."," What's the point if the world starts appreciating us but we lose all our freedoms? No other way to keep so many ethnicities, religions and class groups working together, I'm afraid.

And no way of ensuring that the Indian Mao doesn't kill us all. WE  👏 NEED 👏 EDUCATIONAL 👏 REFORMS 👏 PERIOD.","Is democracy right for India? This is just meant to be a ""what-if"" post and nothing to be taken serious. This is to promote a healthy debate.

[https://www.hotstar.com/in/movies/war-dogs/1221111905](https://www.hotstar.com/in/movies/war-dogs/1221111905)"," So basically, ALL THE WARNER BROS(Minus HBO) STUFF?! Correct me if I’m wrong - Matrix,Gravity, Chris Nolan(Dark Knight, Inception), DC(Wonder Woman, joker) Blood Diamond, LEGO, King Kong, Sherlock Holmes, Pacific Rim, Lethal Weapon, 300, Oceans 11, Sully, Gran Torino, etc. are all WB

Guess it makes sense. WB is following suit to make their own Disney Plus(HBO MAX) and with Disney Plus merging with Hotstar, it shouldnt be totally unexpected that all the Disney-competitor stuff leave.

EDIT - on the TV side too. FRIENDS, Seinfeld, Two and a half men, Big Bang, supernatural already left. And now all the other stuff is going too(except their HBO stuff, of course) Does it mean HOOQs content would disappear from Netflix as well? Can i just say - this is a ridiculously comprehensive list.

Incredible job, OP.","Hooq content is going away from Hotstar soon [Full List of Content Leaving Hotstar] Hooq filed for liquidation last month and hence a lot of content is going to leave Hotstar soon. Here is a comprehensive list of the content going away. Let me know if I missed anything. I will keep updating.

There is no set date on when this content will leave Hotstar. I guess it will be timed with the shutdown of Hooq.

The general public that could swing both ways is on the right side of the political spectrum, because the voice from the BJP's once strongest opponent has been muted (internally & externally).
 I do understand the dynamics of weak leadership, maybe party infighting, also social media and media bias in general, however with the amount of events that have gone down, (riots, protest, mob lynchings, etc) a little peep could have come out from the Congress that would have been heard by the masses."," Congress isn't evolving with time. When Shashi Tharoor entered politics, he took to social media platforms and was one of the most followed leader on twitter but the old horses of Congress rebuked him for that. Cut to 2014 and ever since then, BJP took hold of that space and undertook relentless campaign against opposition in which they have stooped so low as to making personal remarks against any and every leader.


I, and many more people like me, even if they hate BJP to the core,  wouldn't make any objectionable remarks against Modi's wife but that doesn't stop the right wing followers from furthering their vilification campaign so technically you just can't match their level of propaganda because if you do end up coming down to their level to defeat them, they still win.

Congress isn't willing to change its leadership and that has just continued to cost them everything. LS elections were a shitshow for them because in a competition of Rahul vs Modi, you can't expect a person on fence to crossover towards Rahul courtesy partially his own goof ups and partially the edits the IT cell makes to make him look much more stupid than he actually may be. Their wins in assembly elections have all been because of the state leaders but even there they managed to fuck up by sidelining the likes of Pilot and Scindia just because they can't think beyond their veteran leaders.

I'm sure there are many more reasons but these are what I could think of. Obviously some or even all of my opinions may be wrong but this is my understanding of the situation. Only an online war against BJP IT cell could bring in any change Congress has no head. Ever since Sonia G got ill and put her son in charge, it has gone down in terms of power and even in voice. The once strong party that ruled the majority has been reduced to mere crackles that you hear every now and then. Veteran leaders who have experience and ability to lead are being shunned behind the 'leadership'. The son doesn't have experience and has never really been in charge of affairs up until recently. He has been contesting elections from Amethi which is by far one of the worst or the worst performing constituency in the country. He really wasn't groomed to lead the party from the get-go. So now you have a nobody who's where he is because he's the boss' kid. Other than that he has no credentials, no track record, no experience.

I'm encouraged to love myself. But it's a cryptic expression. I've watched countless videos by these soi-disant motivators. The more I watch them the more I hate myself. I've been encouraged to visit mental health professionals. But I cannot at this stage.

A little bit of superglue and a donor plastic piece (like a toothpaste cap etc) can be used to glue the port in place and add additional structural support.

Once secured you can close the laptop and go back to using your computer like normal.

Every single entity in the power business is losing money, nobody wants to invest in the sector because no one cares about contracts and generators don't get paid.

I guess the author will be satisfied when everyone just packs up and goes home eventually and the country is left with severe power shortages.

If the Andhra Govt can arbitrarily declared contracts to be void and call for renegotiation, there is something fucking wrong and there is absolutely a need to enforce those contracts and do it quickly, not 5+ years later when the judicial system comes around to it.

As for private monopolies being better than public monopolies, first of all, none of the proposed privatisation is going to result in private monopolies. Private participation is either done through a PPP or through a licensee model. Not to mention that power distribution is a heavily regulated business. You have to bare it all before the regulator to set tariffs.

& despite this, private operators have consistently proved to be better than state discoms on metrics across the board. Just look at the metrics of Delhi Distribution when it was ""privatised"" in the 2000s.

The author also states that the bill seeks to eliminate subsidies and cross-subsidies and make electricity a luxury item. The author doesn't state that the bill seeks to calculate the tariffs without any subsidies so the tariff determined is actually reflective of the costs incurred and that if the Govt wants to subsidise any particular consumers, they should pay the consumers directly.

As for ""midst of the COVID-19 crisis"", does the author expect everyone in Govt to sit on their ass for months and get nothing done?

The only parties who benefit from the abysmal current state of the power sector in India are under performing state distribution companies and its employees. It is no surprise that the guy writing this article is a patron of a federation representing those exact parties.","Why Is the Centre Pushing a New Electricity Bill in the Midst of the COVID-19 Crisis?

My family has no objection with her and they're just worried about my safety.

Our families are quite opposite

her younger sister is 20 year old and married, my elder brother is 30 year old and bachelor. (he has no plan of marrying till 35)

Currently I do freelancing for social media marketing and earn $500-2k per month {approx $1k}

we're in relationship for 5 years, we both are kinda shy and sweet. so, we both never had fight with ourselves (or even anyone else as a individual!)

I'm athiest (born hindu) but she is religious and do 5x namaz/day, goes to madarsa but still she is pretty chill and open-minded. I'm into dank memes. she never gets offended in any dark memes of her religion.  (she is unicorn)

Her home is in colony (where her 200-300 relatives lives too). so, there is risk of getting lynched by mob while dropping her or picking her. (because I'm hindu)

&#x200B;

Actually I had no intention of marrying till age 30 but I love her so much that I'm even ready to get circumcision for her. and since she wants to marry. so, offcourse I will. I'm willing to do anything for her.

So, the issue is that my family want me to wait few years but in her family there relatives are recommending her mom to marry her with her cousin. (also, they don't know about our relationship and will definitely be against me)

&#x200B;

IDK, what to do!"," This reads like a very subtle shitpost. >I love her so much that I'm even ready to get circumcision for her

Firstly, is that a thing you'll actually have to do!? Yikes bro!

Secondly, as a fellow atheist, it sounds to me like you're prepared to sacrifice a whole lot of your values because you're scared of how religious nuts would react to your decision. While you're prepared to lop body parts off, will the girl be prepared to walk away from her family if they don't accept you? Will she be open to registering a police complaint if they force her in any way? Will she walk out of the colony of relatives and stay with you? Dank memes and all is very good. All that means is that she will show an open mind in private. Coming out in public and going against a community is quite another thing. Please try and make sure you don't skin the pig before you know for sure if the level of commitment is equal both ways. Better play out all these scenarios with her in private before you go public.

Thirdly, a personal opinion. Marriage is stupid. I've been with the woman I love for 8 years. We aren't married. If you both want to live together just start living together. Throwing a big party for everyone and binding your loved one in a contractual obligation is not a necessity. If you're already okay rejecting societal norms and following your own logical reasoning, then why stop at atheism? Why not make life even simpler? Don't put so much importance in a legal agreement, which is all marriage really is.

Lastly, if you do get snipped please share an update. Well you may be an atheist, like the rest of us prolly here, but you could start by maybe showing a bit of respect and sensitivity for her beliefs when, especially when introducing someone you love to a group of strangers. So why dont you do that first and then ask us what we think. Maybe you won't get lynched by her 200 relatives as you mention.

her younger sister is 20 year old and married, my elder brother is 30 year old and bachelor. (he has no plan of marrying till 35)

Currently I do freelancing for social media marketing and earn $500-2k per month {approx $1k}

we're in relationship for 5 years, we both are kinda shy and sweet. so, we both never had fight with ourselves (or even anyone else as a individual!)

I'm athiest (born hindu) but she is religious and do 5x namaz/day, goes to madarsa but still she is pretty chill and open-minded. I'm into dank memes. she never gets offended in any dark memes of her religion.  (she is unicorn)

Her home is in colony (where her 200-300 relatives lives too). so, there is risk of getting lynched by mob while dropping her or picking her. (because I'm hindu)

&#x200B;

Actually I had no intention of marrying till age 30 but I love her so much that I'm even ready to get circumcision for her. and since she wants to marry. so, offcourse I will. I'm willing to do anything for her.

So, the issue is that my family want me to wait few years but in her family there relatives are recommending her mom to marry her with her cousin. (also, they don't know about our relationship and will definitely be against me)

&#x200B;

IDK, what to do!  This reads like a very subtle shitpost. >I love her so much that I'm even ready to get circumcision for her

Firstly, is that a thing you'll actually have to do!? Yikes bro!

Secondly, as a fellow atheist, it sounds to me like you're prepared to sacrifice a whole lot of your values because you're scared of how religious nuts would react to your decision. While you're prepared to lop body parts off, will the girl be prepared to walk away from her family if they don't accept you? Will she be open to registering a police complaint if they force her in any way? Will she walk out of the colony of relatives and stay with you? Dank memes and all is very good. All that means is that she will show an open mind in private. Coming out in public and going against a community is quite another thing. Please try and make sure you don't skin the pig before you know for sure if the level of commitment is equal both ways. Better play out all these scenarios with her in private before you go public.

Thirdly, a personal opinion. Marriage is stupid. I've been with the woman I love for 8 years. We aren't married. If you both want to live together just start living together. Throwing a big party for everyone and binding your loved one in a contractual obligation is not a necessity. If you're already okay rejecting societal norms and following your own logical reasoning, then why stop at atheism? Why not make life even simpler? Don't put so much importance in a legal agreement, which is all marriage really is.

Lastly, if you do get snipped please share an update. Well you may be an atheist, like the rest of us prolly here, but you could start by maybe showing a bit of respect and sensitivity for her beliefs when, especially when introducing someone you love to a group of strangers. So why dont you do that first and then ask us what we think. Maybe you won't get lynched by her 200 relatives as you mention.

Public transport might not be 100% available at the time of exam,  (buses or trains at least)

Some states such as Telangana have increased their lockdown to even 7th May.

And since the decision is to be taken around 3rd or 4th May(for an exam of this scale, they have to inform people well in advance), by that time, most restrictions would be there in place anyway so high probability of prelims getting postponed.

Going by the manner in which they're postponing even the notifications for various exams such as Medical services, CAPF etc they too are deliberating for a new date for the exams.

For interviews, they may be conducted within a fortnight of travel restrictions lifting as they don't require mass assembly/movement of people. I think they’ll delay.

I doubt family or friends can help with a manic/depressive episode. There's no way to predict when the lockdown might end. Sorry to say, but its getting extended. At least in the cities like Delhi NCR, Bombay, Indore. But having said that, I think some restrictions will be listed. In terms of maybe stepping out. Don't expect any public transport or markets to open. Not happening. I saw prep yourself for it to last till July. That's being optimistic.",Coronavirus

g59jnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g59jnx/why_arent_there_movies_made_about_important/,"Why aren't there movies made about important African (Habshi) figures in Indian history? In general, there seems to be so little discussion of Africans and their important historical role in India.","So, I recently did a TON of research and made a video on a man named Malik Ambar.  He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.

His narrative is incredible.

This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.

Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?

I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.

Thoughts?

It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

Edit: as people are asking me to post the link here for added visibility, [https://youtu.be/beXIBdLvvPc](https://youtu.be/beXIBdLvvPc)."," 1. It's a regional empire - most regional histories are underweighted, ignored  in India. This is a major factor

2. It's not particularly resonant with existing state governments and parties in power.  eg maharashtra is shivaji this and shivaji that. No particular state takes up some of these stories now like the sultanate

3. It is not super recent.  History in itself is not told well, except as lip service, rote elements, fables, vague allusions to great indian past/ history, or injustice done by brits , etc etc . Few people really take to studying history.

4. It doesn't bespeak any broad trends in history - eg colonialism, nation state etc.

5. Malik Amber, on the face of it doesn't scream african or escaped slavery background.

There are a lot of people with interesting stories in history whose stories could be told.

If you can tell his story in an interesting fashion, you *should* try. Racism could be a reason seeing how they are treated in society today.

PS. You should post that video you made. For those interested, here's the episode on Malik Amber from [Sunil Khilnani's Incarnations on BBC Radio 4](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05wy644)","Why aren't there movies made about important African (Habshi) figures in Indian history? In general, there seems to be so little discussion of Africans and their important historical role in India. So, I recently did a TON of research and made a video on a man named Malik Ambar.  He's an Ethiopian slave who became a de facto king in the Deccan and successfully defended his kingdom against Mughal invasion.  What shocked me is how I would not have ever known about his existence if I wasn't already doing a deep-dive into Deccan history.

His narrative is incredible.

This man was sold into slavery by his own parents, then climbed his way to the top of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate and led a Deccan resistance movement against the Mughal Empire.  Jahangir was so pissed off that he had a painting commissioned of himself shooting Malik Ambar in the head with an arrow.

Why is there so little interest in the Habshi community and their historical exploits?

I mean, Malik Ambar is not even the only one with an interesting story.  There's the Bijapur minister Ikhlas Khan, there's the Habshis who took over the Bengal Sultanate, the independent Habshi pirates of Janjira Island, and more.

Thoughts?

It struck me as particularly strange, as many African communities in India are treated poorly today.  Seems like if more people knew how intricately tied they are to our histories, there would be more respect.

Edit: as people are asking me to post the link here for added visibility, [https://youtu.be/beXIBdLvvPc](https://youtu.be/beXIBdLvvPc).  1. It's a regional empire - most regional histories are underweighted, ignored  in India. This is a major factor

2. It's not particularly resonant with existing state governments and parties in power.  eg maharashtra is shivaji this and shivaji that. No particular state takes up some of these stories now like the sultanate

3. It is not super recent.  History in itself is not told well, except as lip service, rote elements, fables, vague allusions to great indian past/ history, or injustice done by brits , etc etc . Few people really take to studying history.

4. It doesn't bespeak any broad trends in history - eg colonialism, nation state etc.

5. Malik Amber, on the face of it doesn't scream african or escaped slavery background.

There are a lot of people with interesting stories in history whose stories could be told.

If you can tell his story in an interesting fashion, you *should* try. Racism could be a reason seeing how they are treated in society today.

Hey Everyone,

I am bored out of my mind. Since I have experience in the Personal Care Appliance industry, so thought of creating this post to help the first time trimmer buyers in Quarrantine. I have tested all of these products at one time or the other. This seems like a need for many of the people in the male demographic

Note : Only the products which are deliverable will be featured. Currently only Flipkart is delivering so I am only featuring Flipkart Products. Will edit this post later to include

**TLDR**

**Detailed Analysis**

**Beard Trimmer**

**Economy Segment**

[Mi Trimmer](https://www.flipkart.com/mi-xxq01hm-runtime-90-min-trimmer-men/p/itm97cba5cc90e84?pid=TMRFJPH3DBURGEZR) Rs 1199 v/s [Philips QT 3310](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-qt3310-15-runtime-30-min-trimmer-men/p/itmc7efd5003ea13?pid=SHVEHHFBMHJZUZWS) Rs 1349

Spec Wise & Price Wise- Mi Trimmer Wins handily 90 Min Run time, 40 lenght settings & IPX 7 Water proof certification v/s 30 min run time & 11 length settings

Product quality wise - Philips is a a little better. the Comb of Mi Trimmer is not as good as Philips and bends a little bit due to which the precision is a little off. When we come to Philips product quality is something which is unmatched

Decision - Mi Trimmer is the smarter buy but Philips is the market leader for a reason. So if you want extreme precision go for Philips, if not go for Mi

**Premium Segment**

[Philips Oneblade](https://www.flipkart.com/philips-oneblade-qp2525-10-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itme7abf466a4689?pid=TMRFGZ22R3FNMC8U) \- Rs 1999 Best Personal care product to have been launched last year. As close to a shave as you can get.

Specs are decent 45 min run time but the trim quality is the best I have seen in any trimmer. No competition

**2. Full Body Grooming Kits -**

Philips does not really have a good selection in Grooming Kits

**Economy Segment**

[Beardo All-in-1 Trimmer Kit](https://www.flipkart.com/beardo-pr3058-59-runtime-45-min-trimmer-men/p/itm8713077ee0cef?pid=TMRFKH8DNJFR2DEU) \- A good Product at a affordable price. - Rs 1299

**Premium Segment**

Similar case as the Trimmer Segment. Nova has great specs 160 min Runtime which is next level while Syska is marginally better in Product Quality and lower in specs 10 length Setting and 50 min run time. No of attachments are same standard ones

My Suggestion is to go for Nova 1153 if pin point accuracy is not required otherwise go for Syska 3052

**Hair Clippers**

Most of the selection is segment is not available right now. The best brand is Wahl but they are not instock right now

[Nova NHT 1083](https://www.flipkart.com/nova-professional-rechargeable-cordless-nht-1083-hair-clipper-runtime-120-min-trimmer-men/p/itm486bb70a84e66?pid=TMRFNHCHCXARGRZK) \- Newer Product with decent Specs 120 min run time. 5 Length Settings for hair. Reviews and ratings are good

I can't imagine what happens when they make the restrictions a little lax. With the population it's bound to spread like wildfire especially in India. 

I don't know if the public will take the stay at home order beyond May3rd either. They need Stay at home till a treatment shows total benefit, a vaccine becomes available, and so on. 

But it's not controllable in India. It feels like a doomsday seekers statement but sadly this is the truth. Observing the trend I think the pandemic is here to stay in India those who get infected and recover will become immune and some unfortunate ones will not recover lockdown or not that’s it- all this because of unprepared incompetent governance Yeah, we can't hold a lockdown post 3rd . Our economy will absolutely crumble beyond what it has already. The only , THE ONLY silver lining is that despite inadequate testing , repeated lockdown violations etc at the very least till now the death rate / mortality rate in india combined with the number of SARI cases has been really really small. I don't know why, no one knows why but some unknown factor might be working in our favor , it might just be the lockdown tbh but who knows tropical heat (yes I know it hasn't been proved but it also hasn't been disproved yet because studies are going to take time), maybe it's because of BCG vaccinations, maybe the younger population, maybe inherently stronger immunity towards Coronaviruses (the family of viruses not the one causing Covid19) etc . Hopefully by early next year the situation at least starts to resemble normalcy. 

Ps - if this hasn't slowed down in maharashtra by monsoon, god help us cuz the situation is going to turn absolutely desperate.","COVID-19 cases curve is not flattening in india   With almost majority staying indoors, there's still spread.

In the last few days, me and my family have had these curious nocturnal visitors. We initially thought they were some sort of wild cats.

We were to be proved wrong soon enough and we know them as palm civets. Palm civets are a strange bunch of mammals with tails that look like that of the cats. 

We now know that these one of the civets entered our house and crapped all over our kitchen. We initially thought it was a rat until we caught a juvenile palm civet in a trap. I rode to a place full of trees without many people around and released the animal there.

The animal is now separate from its family and probably hiding somewhere. Knowing my parents, they would have had the animal killed merely out of fear. Now, I need to know if I did it right. Did I ensure that the animal will have a new lease of life or only bought it some time?"," Don't worry bro, I know this plot.

Does New Zealand not do repatriation? 

And do you have any evidence, either a written statement or screenshot or recording, of the message that you can only apply two days beforehand? 

What I would personally do is see if there is an email for the embassy and put it in writing that you are getting this message that you have to wait two days and will be abiding by that as per the instructions given to you. 

Most likely, India won't allow international flights until June and will automatically extend the visa, but just in case you face any trouble later, it's better to have documentation that you tried to follow their policies.

But situation as it is, COVID-19 means that I am now in a dilemma because of 2 reasons -

  


1. Most politicians and Economists agree that even after the COVID-19 pandemic is under control, the recession it has started will continue. Does this mean that this is not the best time to be graduating from a business school?

What would be your suggestion for me. I have to make the initial payment by the 24th.


Update: I emailed the University about taking a deferment of my application and they replied saying they do not allow deferred admission. I feel that the situation is less likely to improve to a level where I can make foreign travel.

Imo it doesn’t make sense to pay the same fee for an online course; that too from a business school where f2f interactions are so important. What’s the initial payment they have asked for btw?

In terms of job I feel it will be more difficult but definitely not impossible to find a job in SG or back in India.

We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes. If it wasn't so time sensative, I could wait, but we are out of time for me to be super super patient."," Every human being is different, so please take my generalized advice with a pinch of salt:


There's a strong division in Indian society between what is public and what is private. Please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with American ideas. In many Indian communities, dating is now common in the younger generation, but telling your family about a significant other = an engagement. So in an Indian context, for many people, its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement.  
If your relationship is strong in every other way, a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part. Assuming your relationship is in good shape in every other way, she isn't ""hiding behind"" Indian culture, she's doing her best to balance her family's worldview with your worldview, and this takes time and effort. Many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process. 

Perhaps one way to proceed is to get on her team, become her partner and ally in negotiating between cultures. After all, once you marry an Indian, you've joined the wild and subtle dance of inhabiting multiple cultures for life, my friend.  So ask questions, something like:

- What does your family think about X?
- What can we do to set them at ease about X?
- How can we communicate to them that XYZ is important to me/us?
- What is important to them / what are their concerns about X?

Get yourselves on the same team, so that you're not another node in the cultural tug-of-war. 

Once more, every person and every relationship is unique, and so is every family, so take my thoughts with a pinch of salt. Dude. I’m an Indian girl engaged to a non indian, and half my family still doesn’t know. Trust me, it’s less drama this way. Ask her if her mom is against the extended family knowing. How does she plan to break the news of the marriage to them? How old are you both?","So, I'm an American dating a South Indian, and I need some advice So, I'm dating a grad student from Coimbature. We're the same age, however, she's getting a 2-year Gradaute Degree from the same college here in America where I'm getting my Bachelors from.   
Here's some background information: 

  
1. She's going to make a lot more money than me. It hurts my pride (American who was raised to take care of his family), but I can live with not being the ""primary bread winner."" 

2. I understand that India has a lot of arranged marriages. That's the culture; does not bother me. However, what does bother me is... 

3. Her sister and her mother, and a few friends know about me. But she doesn't want other family to know because she's scared of how she thinks they will think about us, or something like that? She can never really give me a clear answer, but it seems like she's so scared for her extended family to know about us. And that's where the problem lies.   


  
We are already talking about getting married. However, because we are about to graduate, we are not able to stay where we are, because of money. We are talking abotu getting engaged soon, but she has family in America that she can move in with, and I don't currently. I also don't want to be in different parts of the country if we are planning on getting married soon.   


  
So, the help that I am requesting is, what can I do to help her understand how important it is for her to let that family that needs to know about us know, so that we can get things settled? If she wants to wait to tell extended family, that's fine. I understand how different Indian and American cultures are. But, we're planning on staying in the United States, she is wanting to marry an American... is there a way for me to get her out of her shell of hiding behind Indian culture and family politics and understand why it means to me, an American, to know what our future holds without being a complete asshole or jerk? I really love the girl, and do genuinely want to marry her, but the difference in cultures is a roadblock, and it is so frustrating sometimes. If it wasn't so time sensative, I could wait, but we are out of time for me to be super super patient.  Every human being is different, so please take my generalized advice with a pinch of salt:


There's a strong division in Indian society between what is public and what is private. Please know that these conceptions are not universal and do not overlap exactly with American ideas. In many Indian communities, dating is now common in the younger generation, but telling your family about a significant other = an engagement. So in an Indian context, for many people, its putting the cart before the horse to announce the relationship prior to an engagement.  
If your relationship is strong in every other way, a reluctance to tell the extended family does not signify a lack of belief in it on her part. Assuming your relationship is in good shape in every other way, she isn't ""hiding behind"" Indian culture, she's doing her best to balance her family's worldview with your worldview, and this takes time and effort. Many people who have to inhabit multiple worlds go through this process. 

Perhaps one way to proceed is to get on her team, become her partner and ally in negotiating between cultures. After all, once you marry an Indian, you've joined the wild and subtle dance of inhabiting multiple cultures for life, my friend.  So ask questions, something like:

Usually, the spectators are the school kids if the tournament takes place in the school. Such was case for basketball and carrom district and skating state. Basketball crowd was more in number than any other because its a sport with some watch value I guess. Swim nationals were in sports complex and a 5km open ocean so hardly anyone came. Yes. We had a treasure hunt and a dance off, in the end it was a triathlon. Everyone was allowed to participate but only boys were chosen for the last triathlon race. IDK why. Maybe girls aren't supposed to take part in sports, they cheered us with poms poms though. That was nice.

Also had to spend on a fucking tuxedo to take part in the dance competition.

I need some quick help. I may be going through a SIM swap/hack, and I need to know if its really happening or I am worrying unnecessarily. 

Yesterday I received an SMS for OTP for an Aadhar card which wasn't mine (the last 4 digits were different). So, I shrugged it off. It didn't occur to me that someone else managed to register my number for their Aadhar.

Today, I received an SMS from Airtel saying that I had requested for a duplicate SIM for my number and I should collect it by contacting local office as xxxx phone number. Only I hadn't. So, I immediately called custom support (had to go through so many hoops, I am kinda angry about that) and asked them about it, and they said that there is no such ongoing SIM change/duplication request for my account and that I needn't worry. On myAirtel app too I don't see any ongoing requests/orders. I tried calling that xxx phone number and it was out of network area.

But I am still on my nerves. How can someone else register my phone number for their Aadhar card? And I don't think it is that likely for Airtel to SMS me about SIM duplication by mistake, and that too the very next day.

Is there something that I am missing? Any recommendations on what I should be doing right now?

Any help is appreciated guys, thanks!

P.S: I checked my own Aadhar card's authentication history anyway, just to confirm, and there are no records for any recent access."," Oh crap. I just recieved an OTP from uber too. I would like to know what's happening.

The message also said to text STOP to some number and obviously I haven't. How old is your current mobile number?
May be the previous owner of mobile number has registered his Aadhar with this mobile number and was requesting the otp now. !remindme 1 day","[Help] Potential SIM swapping/hacking Hi /r/india,

3. Asus  rog strix g doesn't come with a camera. I usually don't use camera in  India but I am going to college outside India and I don't want to carry  an extra accessory with the already heavy laptop. So, I need a camera  inbuilt if at all possible. Lastly,

2. India’s 21-day lockdown may have successfully suppressed the epidemic. Physical distancing is one of the best ways to slow the epidemic and, if anything, many have criticized the lockdown for being too draconian in that regard.
3. India has not been able to test enough to count all cases and deaths. Without sufficient testing, many deaths may not be labeled with Covid-19 for official statistics, leading to an underestimation of the severity of the crisis.
4. India may have protective characteristics against Covid-19.

Hello everyone, I have an SBI account from a Branch which doesn't show up under the list of SWIFT Code across India. And right now, I'm going to receive money from New York but for international transaction, we need a Branch SWIFT code. My main regional Branch does have a SWIFT code though I am not sure if I can use it.

Is there any way by which I can receive money directly to my SBI account? 

I have tried services like TransferWise and PayPal but one doesn't have reception service and the other is charging too much under Exchange rate. And Xoom is not available in India.

Please help.  Try Skrill! Yes the regional branch swift code works. It’ll first bit that branch and then be transferred to your account - quote your full account number and IFSc code - IFSC code denotes bank and branch information in its 11-digits. For example, if an IFSC code is IDIB000J028,

First four digits – ‘IDIB’ is the bank identifier for Indian bank
Fifth digit is ‘0’

In my view, a prudent approach needs to be followed, allowing important industries to start bit by bit, carrying on testing, locking down hotspots, providing for the most vulnerable population while as citizens we try our best to stay at home (go out only on need basis or once in a while), avoid gatherings and maintain social distancing as much as we can.

India doesn't nearly have the capacity to test that many people.

NOTE:- For clarification he is not from Karnataka but has been brought up over there for most of his life. His parents had to abruptly leave and go back to Rajashthan without giving him any prior notice (returned to his native place, ie Rajasthan).

He has attempted to contact the police to get some help, but they simply suggested him to just get a lift from a lorry truck/milk service van to hitch a ride up to his destination.

He was extremely vocal against illegal river sand mining.

Corporates with investments in infrastructure and resort tourism projects were at risk due to his activism. 

With proper media followup, he would have definitely succeeded in galvanizing public opinion for halting these environmentally destructive projects.

I strongly feel diktat has been given from top to media to stop his legacy from reaching out to common man.This must be the fucking reason why he is not newsworthy to our media.

Why do you think mainstream media wants us to focus on Timur ?

Shame on each and every Indian for not knowing about him and his life struggle when he was alive and fighting on our behalf."," What a great man!

### Tl;dr

On 31 March, the Foundation for Media Professionals filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis. During the first hearing on 9 April, the Court issued notice to the Standing Counsel for Government of Jammu & Kashmir. The matter was listed again today i.e. 21 April and the Court directed the Government to file a reply to the petition by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March. The petition was first listed for hearing before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J on 9 April. During the hearing on 9 April, the bench issued notice to the Standing Counsel of Government of Jammu & Kashmir. Read more about the petition and last hearing [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-issues-notice-in-fmps-petition-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-jammu-kashmir-during-covid-19-crisis/).

Subsequent to the petition being filed on 31 March, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir continued to direct ISPs to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G through orders issued under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. These orders issued on 3 April and 15 April were also challenged by the Petitioner by filing additional applications. 

### Practical Impact of the Internet Slowdown

In addition to challenging subsequent internet slowdown orders, the Petitioner also sought to bring on record personal narratives of hardships faced by doctors, teachers, students, journalists, advocates etc in Jammu & Kashmir due to the internet slowdown. FMP’s Director and veteran journalist, Ms. Revati Laul personally spoke to 13 residents of Jammu & Kashmir to collect these narratives.

>*“I have so many patients who are just able to call me this time. I can’t understand what they are trying to tell me exactly...One said,I have pain in the tummy. The tummy is big. It has around 20 organs inside. So then I ask – is it the upper part of the tummy, is it the right side, is it lower? And it becomes very difficult. It’s not possible to accurately pin-point what they’re saying.”* \-Doctor at Srinagar Government Medical College on need for video facilities  
>  
>*“The universities will hold their exams on time. Then no one will speak on our behalf to say to them – oh, there was no 4G, there were no classes. There will only be exams. Did we get any education? Are teachers being sent to our homes? Is there a door to door drive to ensure that students’ education won’t be affected?""* \- Student at Degree College in Bemina

The Petitioner also produced a comparative analysis of web performance at 2G and 4G speed to help the Court fully understand the practical consequences of the internet slowdown. This technical report was authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre, a technologist and policy researcher who had previously also analysed functionality of whitelisted websites in Jammu & Kashmir. The analysis revealed that tasks on observed 2G speed can take upto 50 times longer and 2G network conditions were well below the minimum requirements of video streaming/video communication platforms like YouTube, Zoom and Skype. In addition to this theoretical analysis, Mr. Waghre also carried out a simulated test which found that some interactive interfaces like the World Health Organization’s Situation Tracker did not function at observed 2G speeds at all. 

### What happened at today’s hearing?

During today’s hearing, the bench inquired about a suo moto petition pending before the Jammu & Kashmir High Court on the same issue. In response to this, the Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta indicated that he requires time to seek more information about the suo moto petition and suggested that it may also be transferred to the Supreme Court. 

The Court also sought information about the total number of COVID-19 cases in Jammu & Kashmir. Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for FMP informed the Court that the region had 354 COVID-19 cases. He emphasized that this was a matter of grave urgency and the Government had not filed its response despite notice being issued on 9 April. Therefore, he requested the Court to direct the Government to file its reply expeditiously.

The Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal sought to justify the internet slowdown by claiming that the region had a serious militancy problem. However, the bench directed the Government to file a proper written response and record its submissions on affidavit. The Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta accepted this direction and indicated that the Government will file a consolidated report. 

In addition to FMP’s petition, two more petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services filed by Soayib Quereshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir were also listed for hearing today. Advocate Charu Ambwani representing the Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir highlighted how the education of 27 lakh students was being hampered because they did not have access to high speed internet. In response to a question by the bench, she also stated that most students in Jammu & Kashmir have laptops and tablets so the biggest hurdle is slow internet speed. 

After hearing submissions made by all counsels, the bench directed the Government to file a reply by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April.

### Tl;dr

On 31 March, the Foundation for Media Professionals filed a petition before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis. During the first hearing on 9 April, the Court issued notice to the Standing Counsel for Government of Jammu & Kashmir. The matter was listed again today i.e. 21 April and the Court directed the Government to file a reply to the petition by Sunday i.e. 26 April so the matter could be listed next Monday i.e. 27 April. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March. The petition was first listed for hearing before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J on 9 April. During the hearing on 9 April, the bench issued notice to the Standing Counsel of Government of Jammu & Kashmir. Read more about the petition and last hearing [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/sc-issues-notice-in-fmps-petition-seeking-restoration-of-4g-internet-services-in-jammu-kashmir-during-covid-19-crisis/).

Subsequent to the petition being filed on 31 March, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir continued to direct ISPs to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G through orders issued under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. These orders issued on 3 April and 15 April were also challenged by the Petitioner by filing additional applications. 

### Practical Impact of the Internet Slowdown

In addition to challenging subsequent internet slowdown orders, the Petitioner also sought to bring on record personal narratives of hardships faced by doctors, teachers, students, journalists, advocates etc in Jammu & Kashmir due to the internet slowdown. FMP’s Director and veteran journalist, Ms. Revati Laul personally spoke to 13 residents of Jammu & Kashmir to collect these narratives.

>*“I have so many patients who are just able to call me this time. I can’t understand what they are trying to tell me exactly...One said,I have pain in the tummy. The tummy is big. It has around 20 organs inside. So then I ask – is it the upper part of the tummy, is it the right side, is it lower? And it becomes very difficult. It’s not possible to accurately pin-point what they’re saying.”* \-Doctor at Srinagar Government Medical College on need for video facilities  
>  
>*“The universities will hold their exams on time. Then no one will speak on our behalf to say to them – oh, there was no 4G, there were no classes. There will only be exams. Did we get any education? Are teachers being sent to our homes? Is there a door to door drive to ensure that students’ education won’t be affected?""* \- Student at Degree College in Bemina

The Petitioner also produced a comparative analysis of web performance at 2G and 4G speed to help the Court fully understand the practical consequences of the internet slowdown. This technical report was authored by Mr. Prateek Waghre, a technologist and policy researcher who had previously also analysed functionality of whitelisted websites in Jammu & Kashmir. The analysis revealed that tasks on observed 2G speed can take upto 50 times longer and 2G network conditions were well below the minimum requirements of video streaming/video communication platforms like YouTube, Zoom and Skype. In addition to this theoretical analysis, Mr. Waghre also carried out a simulated test which found that some interactive interfaces like the World Health Organization’s Situation Tracker did not function at observed 2G speeds at all. 

### What happened at today’s hearing?

During today’s hearing, the bench inquired about a suo moto petition pending before the Jammu & Kashmir High Court on the same issue. In response to this, the Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta indicated that he requires time to seek more information about the suo moto petition and suggested that it may also be transferred to the Supreme Court. 

The Court also sought information about the total number of COVID-19 cases in Jammu & Kashmir. Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing for FMP informed the Court that the region had 354 COVID-19 cases. He emphasized that this was a matter of grave urgency and the Government had not filed its response despite notice being issued on 9 April. Therefore, he requested the Court to direct the Government to file its reply expeditiously.

The Attorney General, Mr. KK Venugopal sought to justify the internet slowdown by claiming that the region had a serious militancy problem. However, the bench directed the Government to file a proper written response and record its submissions on affidavit. The Solicitor General, Mr. Tushar Mehta accepted this direction and indicated that the Government will file a consolidated report. 

In addition to FMP’s petition, two more petitions seeking restoration of 4G internet services filed by Soayib Quereshi and Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir were also listed for hearing today. Advocate Charu Ambwani representing the Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir highlighted how the education of 27 lakh students was being hampered because they did not have access to high speed internet. In response to a question by the bench, she also stated that most students in Jammu & Kashmir have laptops and tablets so the biggest hurdle is slow internet speed.

A neurosurgeon had treated one of my family members of a brain tumor.

He had done immense social works in and around the city and his village especially. But after his death, his body remained in morgue for 36 hours as they were refused burial in home by neighbors and in Village's ancestral burial site by his own Villagers for whom he had done several social works. And his own family couldn't do nothing because they were held in quarantine. Finally, some church stepped in and cremated his body at a burial ground.

These COVID-19 warriors are no less than Indian Army. They deserve equal respect if not more. I hope such demoralising events doesn't provoke Healthcare workers to protest against executing their duties.","Chennai: Neurosurgeon dies of Covid-19, mob attacks hearse, tries to stop burial   I dont know what to think of our people anymore.

>  **Before ending his life, the man sold his mobile phone for Rs 2,500 to a buyer and purchased rice, flour and sugar, and a table fan so that his four children could sleep comfortably in the summer heat**. It is impossible to survive 42 days lock down without government delivering food and essential services at door step.

But government is playing jumlabaazi even in corona pandemic. Felt bad reading about this the other day. While one lot of the poor are reaping all the benefits & demand more, when have this other side who cannot even make ends meet.

The first lot typically are the vote banks of local politicians, while the second lot are usually the migrant workers without a base who have come to earn their livelihood.","After arranging food for family by selling his mobile amid lockdown, man hangs self   > In a tragic incident reported from a slum cluster in Saraswati Kunj area in Gurugram, a poor man, in his early 30s, allegedly committed suicide by hanging himself in his tin hutment on Thursday.

They give a lot of homework! and projects to complete which have time till July!  What if a student's pen ink is finished? Now how can he go out and buy pens? Is it even right to conduct online classes during this crisis time? These schools only care about the fees. They are teaching online only because they can at least take half monthly fees!   Some teachers don't even care how the quality is! Why are they even teaching when half of them don't understand! Some wont have a WiFi! What about them? DO they have to use mobile data for an online streaming like teaching?"," These are the problems you all should communicate to the school, no?

It's going to be tougher than live class, I don't know about the fees but if schools won't be open for a long time to come then I think online classes will be the way forward to keep the academic year going. Schools should indeed give some concession with fee, as students are not using their infrastructure they are saving enormous expenses on maintenance, electricity and so on.


And online teaching cannot be compared with physical classes.

Schools should ask not more than 50% of fees if schools remain close for next few months.
And mind it schools are only conducting online class as a reason to validate their fee demand they don't care about quality most of schools are using zoom free account and take classes for 40min as it's the limit.
If whole economy is suffering schools cannot expect to have fees on velvet pillow.



And don't get me started about colleges. But this isn't just something Indians are going through. Practically every school and university has moved to online classes around the world. They're simply doing what they can to provide an education. Instead of complaining maybe we should empathise with instructors and faculty, considering they're going through the same conditions as students.","PROBLEMS OF ONLINE CLASSES!

**Context:** More than 324 people have died in the worst flooding in nearly a century in the south Indian state of Kerala.

Roads are damaged, mobile phone networks are down, an international airport has been closed and more than 220,000 people have been left homeless after unusually heavy rain in the past nine days.

Officials repeatedly revised the death toll upwards from 86 people on Friday morning to more than 300 by the evening as a massive rescue operation reached more flood-hit regions. “Around 100 people died in the last 36 hours alone,” a state official said.

Casualty numbers are expected to increase further, with thousands more people still stranded and less intense though still heavy rain forecast for at least the next 24 hours. Many have died from being buried in hundreds of landslides set off by the flooding. ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/17/kerala-floods-death-toll-rescue-effort-india))

**Arm chair lawyers read this:** We do not condone karma whoring. But. Butt. But, this post is infinitely more useful than the 'oh look at this pretty photo (I took or I lifted from the internet)' threads. And about admins, yeah, they need to focus on cleaning reddit and get rid of hateful fucks that pose actual threat against people. They should focus on subs dedicated on harassing people. They should focus on subs accommodating and/or encouraging bigotry in the guise of free speech and/or dark humor. This harmless post, an attempt at raising awareness towards actual suffering of actual people should be fine. It ought to be anyway. </rant>

 I'll match your donation, OP

EDIT: Woke up to see this rapidly went out of my *aukaat*, so [here's my meager donation to the cause](https://imgur.com/a/CJykel3). I hope my brothers and sisters from Kerala can forgive me. 

As compensation, I'm going to spend the rest of today and tomorrow volunteering in the collection drives around Hyderabad. If anyone is in town, do come by and drop off anything you can spare. Packaged food, blankets, sanitary pads, and of course water bottles. They never have enough water during the floods. I remember how there were people charging 1000 rupees a bottle during the Uttarakhand floods. 

I will also be asking my friends to donate as much as they can. Cheers and I hope the storm blows over quickly.  Was hoping to match OP's amount, but this is fast going out of my *aukaat*. So here's my contribution: https://i.imgur.com/R7E3btm.png

  **Update:** Since this thread has gone off the front page of /r/India, I posted a part II sort of thread. Please continue here - https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/98j4po/kerala_floods_informationhelpdonations_megathread/

#Verified donations so far ~INR 700K


#Huge shout out to all donors! This is brilliant! Couple of updates:

1. Dear /u/TheBeginnerr, you have donated enough. Don't bankrupt yourself. The rest of us can continue contributions. No one will think any less of you if you didn't match exact 3x of upvotes.

2. If you post screenshot of your donation (please make sure you hide personal details, transaction ID, bank details etc.) then /u/root_su will gild you. Just our way of saying thanks. We know donating to the cause has higher precedence right now. This is gold credit he already has. Not buying gold right now. 

3. If you have medium of donation that works well for people currently outside India, then please share as a reply to this comment (and tag me). I will update this comment.

**Context:** More than 324 people have died in the worst flooding in nearly a century in the south Indian state of Kerala.

Roads are damaged, mobile phone networks are down, an international airport has been closed and more than 220,000 people have been left homeless after unusually heavy rain in the past nine days.

Officials repeatedly revised the death toll upwards from 86 people on Friday morning to more than 300 by the evening as a massive rescue operation reached more flood-hit regions. “Around 100 people died in the last 36 hours alone,” a state official said.

Casualty numbers are expected to increase further, with thousands more people still stranded and less intense though still heavy rain forecast for at least the next 24 hours. Many have died from being buried in hundreds of landslides set off by the flooding. ([Source](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/17/kerala-floods-death-toll-rescue-effort-india))

**Arm chair lawyers read this:** We do not condone karma whoring. But. Butt. But, this post is infinitely more useful than the 'oh look at this pretty photo (I took or I lifted from the internet)' threads. And about admins, yeah, they need to focus on cleaning reddit and get rid of hateful fucks that pose actual threat against people. They should focus on subs dedicated on harassing people. They should focus on subs accommodating and/or encouraging bigotry in the guise of free speech and/or dark humor. This harmless post, an attempt at raising awareness towards actual suffering of actual people should be fine. It ought to be anyway. </rant>


###edit n: Bears. Beets. Battlestar Galactica.

 I'll match your donation, OP

EDIT: Woke up to see this rapidly went out of my *aukaat*, so [here's my meager donation to the cause](https://imgur.com/a/CJykel3). I hope my brothers and sisters from Kerala can forgive me. 

As compensation, I'm going to spend the rest of today and tomorrow volunteering in the collection drives around Hyderabad. If anyone is in town, do come by and drop off anything you can spare. Packaged food, blankets, sanitary pads, and of course water bottles. They never have enough water during the floods. I remember how there were people charging 1000 rupees a bottle during the Uttarakhand floods. 

I will also be asking my friends to donate as much as they can. Cheers and I hope the storm blows over quickly.  Was hoping to match OP's amount, but this is fast going out of my *aukaat*. So here's my contribution: https://i.imgur.com/R7E3btm.png

Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing.

You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people.

 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Dear r/all please do take the time to know about the recent religious riots happening in the Capital city delhi /r/India"," I don't think ""atheist"" or ""none"" is an option under the official column of religions in India. So if you are born in a Muslim family you'll forever be a Muslim, unless you convert to some other religion. There are officially no ""atheists"" in India. We need to change this and develop the atheist culture in India. Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?
Then He is not omnipotent.

Is He able, but not willing?
Then He is malevolent.

Is He both able and willing?
Then whence cometh evil?

Is He neither able nor willing?
Then why call Him God?

Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips  
And so Nature, she divines this alternative  
We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever  greets us on the other end  
Is kind enough to fill us in  
And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever   since  

Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to   address  
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron     deficient  
So somebody's got to go kill something while I look    after the kids    
I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this   thing its milk?  
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we   can switch  
It's hard not to fall in love with something so   helpless  
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this  

Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy  
Just waiting until the part where they start to   believe

And some all powerful being endowed this horror   show with meaning  

Oh, their religions are the best  
They worship themselves yet they're totally   obsessed  
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,   these unbelievable outfits  
And they get terribly upset  
When you question their sacred texts  
Written by woman-hating epileptics  
 
Their languages just serve to confuse them  
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure  
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring  
And hand out prizes when someone patents the   cure  
Where did they find these goons they elected to   rule them?  
What makes these clowns they idolise so   remarkable?  
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new   gods   
So they can go on being godless animals  

Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but   to believe  
Their horizons that just forever recede  
And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a   prison of beliefs  
That they never ever have to leave  

Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman   would conceive!  
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive   is the struggle to survive  
But the only thing that they request is something   to numb the pain with

fyyx8c,https://i.redd.it/3rol63nk35s41.jpg,The wealth inequality in India is truly horrifying,," Source? Damn! These south Indians always get the good things! /s This inequality will happen when we have a free market economy, but no social democracy. Like in the USA, and now India, which emulates them. 

Unless a country offers free world class education and healthcare, this gap will only increase. Most European countries that offer these don’t have such a yawning gap between the rich and poor. Tax money is used to give free education and healthcare of a very high degree of quality. 

When free quality education is lacking, opportunities to the poor are denied because the rich will send their children to the good schools, and will obviously have a head start over their poor counterparts for quality jobs. And the rich-poor gap will only increase. But if the poor were to receive the same (and free) quality education, they will be able to compete on a equal footing, and this gap will slowly reduce. 

Healthcare is a major financial burden when people get seriously ill. The rich have access to the best healthcare, and they can afford it. The not-so-well off will see a major chunk of their savings shaved off if they fall seriously ill. Only a free quality healthcare system will allow them to not worry about this expense head. But as things stand today, here too we are copying the USA system of healthcare (one of the worst in the western world), where the insurance companies make all the money, and yet this is denied to the poor. 

Our tax money needs to go into these two heads if the country’s rich-poor divide is to reduce. Else the situation will get progressively worse, something that we are currently witnessing. 

But our political class does not have such a vision. So it’s all a pipe dream.","The wealth inequality in India is truly horrifying   Source? Damn!

* [Unilever's Mercury Fever](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=624)

The summary of these articles would be as follows,

A company called Ponds moved its thermometer factory from the US to Kodaikanal in 1982.

HLL took over Ponds, ran operations till 2001.

A shitton of Mercury was found onsite and Greenpeace and other NGO's have been on the case.

What has been ignored because of lack of visibility is the plight of my village (which I will not name). My village sits right on the Kodai foothills and till the year 2000, our only source of water was a river that ran through the village. The river ran very close to the Ponds factory.

I have since 2001 been seeing an exponential death rate due to cancer. I myself lost my Grandmom to cancer in 2004, my tiny village of around 5,000 people has seen about 250 cancer deaths in just the past 5 years. That is a 5% mortality rate just from cancer. India has by comparision a 0.05% mortality rate. In other words my village has a 8500% greater mortality rate from cancer as compared the nation at large. 

If you factor in other variables like lifestyle caused cancer like Lung cancer because of smoking, and the fact that the vast majority of the 250 dead had none of these (or exposure to pollution for that matter) habits the numbers would look worse.

I want to bring this to the attention of somebody. I am not even looking at a case or a payout or anything, but just to bring this to some form of limelight. Do I just spam media outlets with an email, or should I contact GP / other NGO's...ideas are welcome.

>>Moss samples collected from trees surrounding the Berijam Lake, located 20 km from the factory, were also tested. Mercury levels were in the range of 0.2 µg/kg, while in Kodaikanal Lake the lichen and moss levels were 7.9 µg/kg and 8.3 µg/kg, respectively. Fish samples from the Kodaikanal Lake also showed mercury levels in the range of 120 to 290 mg/kg.

>>The fish in Kodaikanal Lake are contaminated, and this has caused the loss of livelihood for many people. Water as far as Madurai, a major city about 130kms from Kodaikanal, has been contaminated. That's no surprise because the contaminated water from the mountains was bound to flow onto the plains below.

This article talks about a town 130 Km's away and one that has no direct linkage to it via any river. My village is 20 kms from Berijam (about 50 km's by road), and the river in question, the [Varaha](http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/varaha-river-to-flow-unimpeded/article2661510.ece) originated in Berijam.

 Do you have a test report of water sample testing for high mercury? If not, please collect some samples and get it tested. You can get some NGO to sponsor that if you cannot afford it.

Please compile some research papers/studies on the correlation between high mercury content and cancer.

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Edit: Guys please, if something here offends you then please let me know, but please do not downvote this, we dont want her to be remembered this way, we want to get the true story out.

These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. 

The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.

**Actual Events:**

Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. 
The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.

**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.

All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. 

I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.


This is also a reminder to all of  you that everytime you read a story where the victim died in this way might actually just be a cooked up tale. 

For Pranita.

Sad truth of justice system It is incredibly difficult for women to get justice for workplace harassment. My friend was working in a IT company in Bangalore. She had a sleazy manager. It started with verbal assault first. Commenting about her body in lewd manner, not just in office, even outside the campus. Later he started putting her in late night shifts and only she and the manager would be present in the whole floor. He would come to her cubicle and will start talking and even touched her inappropriately. One day he called her into a conference room and closed it. And that's when she lost it and made a formal complaint to the very specific department of HR that handles workplace harassment. 


She and the manager were called in for questioning. Nothing happens for a few days and then she was called in by the HR. She was being put in performance improvement plan with a chance of being ""terminated"" at the end of it if not successfully finished. And that too under the same manager she complained. She put her papers and luckily found a job with in the notice period. 


I don't endorse the public outing of past sexual assaults in twitter or other social media without any substantial evidence or the lack of intent to legally  pursue things. All that does is put a mark on a guy without any proper way to defend himself. But a lot can be done about workplace harassments. It is difficult to prove things. At least the company could support the victim by providing her with a safe space, removing the accused from her chain of reports or transfer to other locations etc. 


Only take severe actions like suspension or termination if the accused was found guilty. Keep the identity of the accused also hidden until the charges are proven. So even if it was a false accusation, he will come out with minimum damage. 


But when women find it extremely difficult to get justice for workplace harassment, this poster looks condescending and unsupportive.","From Swiggy’s Office in Kochi.   It is punishable? Didnot know that. The laws are good , but getting justice is expensive (in terms of money and time both).

> [Welcome AJIT, a ‘Made in India’ Microprocessor](
https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‘made-india’-microprocessor) 

> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. 

> AJIT’s features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today’s market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel’s Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What’s more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ₹100 when it is produced en-masse. 

> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.

> “We have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,” says Prof. Desai

> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‘softcore’, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.


There is a lot more info in the article. ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it?

Pretty much the truth. My own parents have a fucked up, unhappy marriage but like many others, my mother is financially dependent on my father, who never leaves an opportunity to remind her of that. He is physically and verbally abusive to her but she still finds ways to justify his behaviour or just completely ignore the reality. I used to think that this is how everyone's parents were like until I met other couples and now, I feel horrible for my childhood of perpetual fear and trauma while my parents fought and screamed, slept in separate bedrooms and took out their frustrations on me while barely tolerating each other for days on end. They still do this shit but I have learnt to cope with this bull-crap. I developed severe trust issues and a tendency to repress my emotional needs, something which makes a lot of people think I am too cold and reserved.  Don't you ever fucking dare to think that your marriage doesn't affect your kid. Culture and society too. My mom has been in an unhappy marriage with my dad for over a decade now primarily because society will shun me and my brother in the future (and her too) if they split up.

Not blaming her and all, but I think the fact that my parents stayed together in spite of despising each other so much has caused some irreversible trauma to me and how I see relationships.","Unpopular Opinion: Divorce rate in India is less because most women are not financially independent.

What if the police were in on it and framed these guys due to political pressure? The real culprit will get away with it due to such encounters. This is what we need the courts and the trials for. 
I am with the majority public to give the harshest punishment and the most painful death to the real rapists. But the thing is, in such cases how can we be sure that these were the real ones?

But then again the case might have run in court for years and the real culprits, even if guilty, might not have been as severely punished. 
This actually shows the failure of the Indian Judiciary and the how the law simply doesn't provide the appropriate justice. Because the outrage of the public initially for the incident and then the support for this encounter only shows that everyone knows that our law simply doesn't work and thus they believe that the only way to give such monsters(the rapists) the punishment they deserve is doing it out of the courts. And the people are not wrong when they think like this, because our judiciary has almost always failed us in the past. Maybe that's what needs to be changed.

This is giving birth to new life and decomposing itself. What could be better! [deleted] Look at the comments! We fuck up and pollute the entire country without thinking of respect or disrespect. But burying a flag to grow a tree! That's a extreme disrespect for us.        
  
The flag is just a ""symbol"" for a country. Letting a tree grow from it can be symbolised as growth. A symbol is whatever we want it to be!",Non-Political
cbh5qs,https://i.redd.it/93be7z48hh931.jpg,One Inch: The difference between WC final and Billion heartbreaks,," Credit to Jadeja for making a match out of it. If only the top order had shown half the stomach for the fight that Jadeja showed. Bc, the team mgmt fucked this team up. Its unlucky for us that this collapse happened today. But it was a disaster waiting on wings. Who was our number 4 and 5?

 In australia they use dhoni in crunch situations. At that time rayudu was a fixed player, then all of a sudden we saw vijay shankar, in new zealand series we had kedar jadhav and rayudu and, in world cup, we really had a messed up middle order. Don't act surprised pikachu face, whenever rohit and kohli haven't fired in the last year we have struggled. Goddamnit against Afghanistan we scored a paltry 230 round. If that wasn't a warning, what more could be? If it was pant and pandya whom you were going to back, why didn't you play them all the time before the world cup? 

Lets see Every time india or any other team dominates the world scene..all of them got ""finishers"" and a strong middle order .. who's the finisher here? It was bevan for australia, it was yuvraj for india, it was dhoni for india, it was abd for south africa. In today's england you see butler and stokes..etc etc. Australia gave carey the time and see what a player he has become. 

And had it not been for jadeja where would we have been reeling? 

Today all of a sudden you send DK at 5, and what's his net experience in this world cup? Some 15 20 deliveries.

India of late is over dependent on 2 - 3 players in batting. This isnt good, and the effects of it will be well felt by next world cup if remedial measures are not taken. Lets see where teams that were over dependent on a few players are today. Sri Lanka. (Sanga, jayawardane, dilshan). South africa (amla, abd, duplessis). Its high time we fix this

Consider this a rant. Forgive me for venting my frustration First of all, Hats off to **Jaddu and Dhoni !** If not for them, the match would have ended long back

Secondly, no one can blame Dhoni. Yes, he missed today. But blame the top order who fell for single digits in a WC semi final. 

Thirdly, the sheer number of people lashing out on Dhoni speaks volumes on the hope and expectation people have on Dhoni. Remember for a billion people, match was not over irrespective of whether 3 or even 6 wickets were down. So, as long as Dhoni stood he carried the hopes of a **billion people**. This is reminiscent of periods where Sachin would be India's Lone Ranger. I will cherish today's memory throughout my life. Maybe India had better players in the past. But for me **Sachin** and **Dhoni** forever !","One Inch: The difference between WC final and Billion heartbreaks   Credit to Jadeja for making a match out of it.

 I work in an E.R in Southern California and I’ve found the way they work to be really weird. 

If you arrive by ambulance, A doctor will see you initially to make sure you’re stable. After you’ve been registered (my job) we check to see which doctors are covered by your insurance. That will decide what surgeons/specialists/hospitalists you will have access to. 

Sometimes you won’t be covered at our hospital at all and I will call an ambulance to take you to a hospital that will take your insurance. 

You will always receive emergency treatment at any hospital, but as soon as you’re deemed stable your level of care is determined by your insurance.

oil on canvas
36""x36""

This is painting of my granduncle who I visit almost every year in India. He has always been a very cheerful and jolly man, almost like my own santa growing up.  During my recent visit in 2016, he was not the same.  He would often come around the village with his grandchildren around his shoulders. This time I would go to visit him, in a small room on the side of the road. The room was connected to the larger family house but there was a sense of isolation and exclusion there. 

I think he was alone, away from his family. He had lost about 50 lbs and was not able to communicate any sort of happy expression. He sat up when he saw me but deep down, there was an underlying loneliness I could relate to. It was almost like he was just waiting for the end.

I can relate to that deep sense of not belonging and often try to communicate it through some of my portraiture. It is in many ways baffling to me how we can be moving inward together, at the same time, not knowing we are not going through it alone.  Unfortunately, I feel at times my culture has been a factor in that. Things are often unsaid and misunderstood. I've grown up not knowing how to express internal conflict and struggle because it just wasn't something practiced at the family table. Eventually I would like to create enough work for exhibits and to bring some light to issues of mental health to the general public but also to my own culture.   

The goal of the painting was to portray the overall mood so I started the painting with a large brush to cover the initial layer. 99% of the painting after that was in palette knife. The knife allows me to create movement, texture, and atmosphere in a few sessions instead of having to layer with a brush. I don't know why but this reminds me so much of [this image](http://www.culturalindia.net/iliimages/Bhagat-Singh-ili-24-img-5.jpg) of Bhagat Singh Always loved the Punjabi getup and persona, your granduncle and your painting really personified both!

The old man walked ahead and then I saw these two kids whispering to each other and then suddenly they left the footpath and joined the rally and started shouting slogans right in the middle. 
The happiness on their faces and that entire incident unfolding was my best experience at the rally yesterday. It's the emperor who has no clothes today. Props to the Telegraph for calling that out.",Politics

Bhanwari Devi was gang raped in presence of her husband who was tied and beaten up while her wife was raped. She was on govt of Rajasthan's payroll to inform the administration about child marriages.

She reported a child marriage and the family 'Raped her to teach her a lesson'.

When she went to file FIR against the culprits, police asked her to deposit her 'Lehnga' as an evidence. She covered her lower part with the blood stained turban of her husband and walked 3 Kms to her village.

District court acquitted all accused and made the following remarks in the judgement:

1) It is hard to believe that the wife was raped in front of the husband and he didn't retaliate.

2) No uncle-nephew duo can do rape.

3) No upper caste men can rape lower caste women as that would disgrace their own caste.

You find it hard to believe it coming from the Judiciary?

Believe it or not. This is the truth.

If Kejriwal did that, he will lose a huge share of the Hindu vote. His best bet is to keep the issues focused to local problems and show his work and win.

Passing anti-CAA resolutions and visiting JNU/Jamia etcetera will only consolidate the Hindu vote in favour of the BJP and give them additional seats.

What's more important? Actually having a full majority term for five years or two months of strong anti-CAA protests and sitting in the opposition for the next half a decade?

If this was pre-2015 Kejriwal, he would have taken a mattress and slept in with the people of Shaheen Bag, but this is 2020 Kejriwal. Dude is an astute politician now and sees the big picture.

Electricians, handymen, plumbers: never on time, show up whenever they want, get upset when you say you are now busy. Cant install taps correctly (hot is cold, cold is hot), too near the sink so to get water on your hands you have to touch the sink, poor earthing.

* Then I experienced a satisfaction almost equal to 1/10th of an orgasm when I saw their faces while they ""inform"" my dad(who couldn't give two shits about it. He's cool like that.)

* Then some other bullshit was uttered around me about homeopathy, patanjali or some pehelwan in some gali or chowk who can cure me within a minute.

* Then came a 2nd wave of gasps and horrific squeals when they realized there is no temple or statue at home.

* In the evening my girlfriend comes from work, so naturally my relatives **HAD** to know what her parents do, earn, spend, overpronate, underpronate???

* Then when they were checking out the rest of the house and saw that the bedroom is being shared (and this is the best part) they acted as if I've murdered their children.

* My bua also got disgusted when she found out I was washing both of ours clothes as it is *ladies* work (This is the only time I was legit pissed) 

* My gf has a full sleeve tattoo for which my maami had a questionnaire ready

* Honb'l mention- It was Navratri and the maid had prepared chicken and rice in Lunch so that was fun.

* Another honb'l mention: All of them know that I drink. Because I got many of my cousins drunk in a family wedding some years back. But when they found the bottles and asked me whether she drinks or not and when I said yes she does. Their immediate response was *But girls can't drink.*  
As if it's anatomically impossible for chicks to drink alcohol.

Guys, if this video even remotely made you curious about Indian football do join us on r/IndianFootball, we would love to interact with you and discuss the game.

Mumbaikars over here, if possible try to attend the game on 4th June vs Kenya. Trust me it will be a good experience. We are on form after scoring 5 past Taiwan (check out these goals [5-0](https://streamable.com/4c8d0), [4-0](https://streamable.com/cwhpq), [3-0](https://streamable.com/z3e9u)) and Kenya are a tough team, it will be a good result if we can win tomorrow. 

Now let's go through the usual excuses that will stop you from going to the game.

**The timings are weird:** No they are not, the kick off is at 8:00 PM, after office hours for most.

**The stadium is far:** Mumbai Football Arena, Andheri. It is right next to the Azad Nagar Metro Station.

**It's raining:** Well most of the stands at the stadium are covered, so no worries there.

**Where to get tickets/ tickets are expensive:** Buy them from [Bookmyshow](https://in.bookmyshow.com/sports/football/intercontinental-cup-tournament/india-vs-kenya/seat-layout/aerialview/ET00075919/SRCX/10023). Tickets are 250 and 500. I leave it to your judgement to decide if that is expensive. 

Need another reason. Tomorrow **Chhetri will get his 100th Cap for the National Team**, all the more reason to see the team in action live. This is what happens when you host matches in cities where the Indian national team has less fan following.Why not host these international matches in Kolkata , Kochi, Guwahati or even Aizawl or Bengaluru .  Really hope one day India will play the FIFA World Cup ","Abuse us, criticise us but please come watch Indian team play: Sunil Chhetri appeals to football fans   (reposting this comment with match details since original post was removed)

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

* Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

In short, the act is discriminatory in nature as it clearly states that India is only interested in taking non-Muslim refugees from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Coupled with NRC, CAA will create a hostile environment for Indian Muslims where they will be at the complete mercy of the government."," If you are an Indian muslim and you have documents dating before 2014 proving your presence in India (say, birth certificate or passport), will you also have to prove your citizenship then? My father just stated today that India shouldn't have been made secular.

When i asked him what should be done with jains, sikhs and Buddhists, he replied that they are a part of Hindus.

No answer for Christians or parsies or Jews but wanted Muslims out of India. Random observation: this whole CAB seems to be like a weird attempt to introduce something in India similar to what Israel does, called Aliyah (the right of return to the land of Israel that any Jew in the world can do):

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah)","An attempt to address the list of ""simplified"" explanation that is floating around in an attempt to justify the Citizenship Amendment Fact First, the justifications that have been floating around

* Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way

* Whom does it apply to? Ans. Only to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians from 3 countries, who are facing religious persecution in those countries AND who are already in India before 1st Dec 2014.

* Which 3 countries? Ans. Pakistan, Bangladesh & Afghanistan

* In what way does it benefit Hindus, Sikhs, Jains,Buddhists, parsis & Christians from these 3 countries? Ans. Their residency requirement has been reduced from 11 to 5 years. And they can claim citizenship as a right under this law

* Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

* Will illegal muslims immigrants from these 3 countries be automatically deported under this bill? Ans. No. The usual process applies. Their application for naturalisation as citizens will be as per the governing law and based on demerits of the case

* Can Hindus facing persecution in other countries apply under this law? Ans. No

* Does this bill apply to other forms of persecution – Political, racial, sexual etc? Ans. No. The bill is very specific in its intent – religious persecution of above notified minorities in these 3 countries

* Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan

* What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils

* Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve. But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

* Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Now, let's address them. 

>Does the CAB Bill affect Indians(Hindus, Muslims, anyone)? Ans. No. It has nothing to do with Indians in any way.

That's blatantly false. The CAB automatically gives citizenship to non-Muslims even if they are illegals. The BJP will then impose a nationwide-NRC. Indian Muslims will now require extraordinary proof to prove their Indian citizenship. 

NRC will follow after CAB. Amit Shah said this himself: https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1205047059654402048

**[Here’s Amit Shah saying non-Muslims won’t even need to submit documents for NRC since they’ll be given citizenship anyway.](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1207191726785323008)**

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

India is not a party to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees or the 1967 Protocol, nor does it have a legal framework and national refugee status determination system. 

So there is no way for a Muslim refugee from those 3 countries to come to India. They can never get Indian citizenship. 

>Does this mean that Muslims from these 3 countries can never get Indian citizenship? Ans. No. But they will go thro’ the usual process of acquiring citizenship thro’ naturalization rules….11 years of residence etc.

No, they don't have to go through the ""usual process of acquiring citizenship"". They are under-trial for the crime of entering India illegally or overstaying their visas. The Indian law that governs illegal immigrants is The Foreigners Act, 1946. Under this law, illegal immigrants have to deported back to their country. They don't get citizenship. 

>Why only these 3 countries ? And why only religious persecution of above Notified denominations? Ans. These 3 countries have a track record of pervasive, systematic & institutionalized persecution of minority Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists, parsis & Christians especially the perennial persecution in Pakistan.

Among our neighbouring countries, Sri Lanka has a track record of persecuting Tamils, Burma of persecuting Muslims, and China of persecuting Tibetans and Muslims. So no, those three countries are not special. 

>What about Sri Lankan tamils? Ans. (1) The war has been over for the a decade now. (2) There never was any persecution on religious lines. It was on racial faultlines. And over the decades of civil war, the Sri Lankans have put an end to institutionalized discrimination of Tamils.

That's not the point. The point is that we already have Sri Lankan refugees and they have been specifically excluded from this act. 

[ Sri Lankan Tamil refugees— those who fled ethnic violence and those who were born here— fear deportation in the aftermath of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act that excludes them.](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/citizenship-act-aftermath-sri-lankan-tamil-refugees-live-fear-deportation-114097)

>Doesn’t India have an obligation under the UN to take care of refugees? Ans. Yes it does. And it is not shying away from it. But it has no obligation to offer citizenship. Each country has its own rules for naturalization. India is not going to turn away other refugees under this law. It will play host to them under UN rules, in the implicit expectation that some day they will return to their homelands when the conditions improve.

All completely false. As answered above, India is not a party to UN convention on refugees so India is actually not playing by UN rules. We are legally not required to (before CAB) host any refugees. 

>But in the case of Minorities from these 3 countries, this law acknowledges the reality that the environment of persecution in these 3 countries is never going to improve

Apart from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are countries with which India enjoys good diplomatic relations. A better (and more diplomatic) approach would have been to work with them and improve the lot of minorities in those countries. [Bangladesh is already unhappy at us because we clubbed them with Afghanistan and Pakistan](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/bangladesh-india-citizenship-amendment-bill-pak-afghanistan-modi-hasina-1628304-2019-12-14)


>Why shouldn’t Baluchis, Ahmediyas in Pakistan, Rohingayas in Myanmar not be considered for this kindness? Ans. They will be considered under the existing laws. Not under the special category

Again false, there are basically no existing laws under which they can claim asylum in India. We are deporting them.

I want to bring to your attention a possible scam on youtube, and wanted your advice on how to proceed.

I won a phone giveaway contest on the popular tech channel PhoneRadar, in July. PhoneRadar is a pretty huge tech channel, with 924K followers on YT. I was supposed to get an Oppo R17 pro. I was really excited and messaged him my email ID. He replies to me a month later asking me to provide my address within 24 hours, or else I get disqualified, and I sent him my details.

Several months passed by. I kept emailing him once every few days asking about the status. He finally replied on 1st November saying ""I will get back to you soon."". No reply since.

&#x200B;

Eventually I started posting on his videos begging him to reply, but no response.

Today I tweeted on his handle telling him to stop ignoring giveaway winners, which really pissed him off. He says and I quote:"" We don't ignore anyone. You kept spamming questioning without a reason and hence no update happened. You had won the R17 Pro & once we see that you stop the spam and remove the messages we will initiate the shipment. ""

So he didnt ship the phone because I asked for the status twice or thrice a month? And he calls me a spammer for that!Its a blatant lie, and what's worse? Its going to fly because his followers will blindly support him.

Please advise what I should do next. Is there any way to bring more attention to his lie and tweets?I have provided proofs of my emails here. I have always been patient and polite to him.

Ultimately gave me almost everything (I need to send application to another dept for part of application) In mean time, I used to ask my relatives about status of bridge toll JLT. and I got to know that one fine day (within 2 weeks, after receiving RTI reply) with lot of fanfare local politician said that he is doing a seva to public by removing the toll on on all such bridges, 13 in total.

Fun Fact: 

* 1. I filed RTI only for one bridge and this corruption was found that bridge dept, local mafia, police and politicians were milking 3-4 lakhs everyday. 5000 vehicles on each bridgex Rs 5 per vehicle x 13 bridges = 3.25 lakh. 
* 2. Cost of bridge (23 lakh) was not recovered even after 25 years. Irony is local politician trying to be saint/hero by not involving in corruption.
* 3. I happen to meet someone who bragged about his uncle being the toll collector for toll station I had filed RTI, while this whole thing was going on.

Please don't think I'm condescending at all. genuinely curious.","Wanted to share this piece I just finished with you guys, ""The messenger""   I am a Sikh from Punjab and never have i ever seen anyone post anything from our state much less a hand drawn painting of one of our Gurus. These days there is very less focus on the religious studies, im actually glad someone is taking an interest in our history and roots. Oil on canvas
30""x40""

A piece I finished earlier this week. It is part of my Punjab series(mostly work from indian roots or religion-sikhism). This one shows the first Sikh guru on his journey as he starts the religion and becomes a missionary. He travels to many different regions of asia and the middle east around the 1500's to learn about different faiths and cultures as well as educate others on his message.

ar504q,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ar504q/people_dont_understand_the_differences_between/,People don't understand the differences between the army and the paramilitary. BUT THEY MUST.,"So I was talking to a friend yesterday who was disturbed by the recent Pulwama attack and during the conversation she referred to the victims as the Indian army soldiers. It wasn't very surprising for me as I've been seeing this misconception for years, even among the educated lot of the country. However, the cowardly attack on CRPF really boiled my blood and I strongly felt that they deserved to be addressed as who they are. And they are not the army. 

Following five forces were earlier considered paramilitary forces, but from March 2011 have been reclassified as Central Armed Police Forces to avoid confusion with Assam Rifles and Special Frontier Force (SFF):

    Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) 
    Border Security Force (BSF) 
    Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) 
    Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) 
    Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB)

CRPF is like the first responder for almost all of the internal security or ""war-like"" situations whereas the army is brought in during the war. CRPF faces the stone pelters in Kashmir. It is they who face bullets of the naxals. BSF guards our borders, not the army always. They have to make way for the army when a war is imminent. ITBP is stationed along the Indo-Tibetan border protects us from the Chinese forces. 

The CRPF or the CAPF in general, comes under the Ministry Of Home Affairs while the army comes under the Ministry Of Defence. MHA has almost equal number of mouths to feed, if not more, compared to the MoD but the MoD takes a substantially bigger piece of the budget pie everytime because MoD procurements are expensive (remember Rafale? I only wonder how all that extra money could have been utilized).

CAPF is not treated on par with the army even in terms of pay & perks. 

>A low-ranking army soldier typically receives one-and-a-half times the pay of a CRPF officer of equivalent experience

>“We’re like a body,” he said, referring to all the security forces, including the army. “Just because the heart is more important, you can’t ignore the knee.”

CAPF personnel live in very poor and conflict ridden conditions for very extended periods of time (remember the BSF jawan's viral video complaining low standards of food?). The conditions that they live in are so dire that diseases like malaria, dengue, heart attacks, depression and suicides kill 16 times more CRPF personnel in maoist hit regions compared to those slain by the rebels. 

>Junior home minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir told the Lok Sabha that 74 CRPF personnel were killed in offensives against the rebels, while 1,196 lost their lives because of medical reasons. In a written reply, the minister said 219 jawans succumbed to heart attacks, 77 died because of depression or by committing suicide, and 20 due to malaria and dengue. Another 880 died due to ""other"" unspecified medical reasons.

They even have a hard time rehabilitating after retirements. Suicide rates are very high in the paramilitary both during and post service.

> Nearly 700 personnel of the Central Armed Police Forces committed suicide in the last six years, more than those killed in action, the Union Home Ministry has told a parliamentary panel. The reasons include ""lack of stability, loneliness and domestic strife"".

TL;DR:

We comfortably deify the army but we don't understand that it is not just the army that is keeping us safe. Being able to make this distinction between our various forces gives us the ability to address their critical concerns. Let us not be so thankless. Let us not be so ignorant. Let us give these brave CAPF soldiers the recognition and status they deserve. 

But more importantly let us pay them well for their services because they are not just fighting for honour, they are also fighting to feed their loved ones, to send their kids to college, to build a house, to pay their old parents' medical bills. In addition to fighting for the country,  these soldiers are fighting for themselves like you and me.

It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days. Sounds like a punishment for eating. 2 days doing nothing looking at walls. That disgusts me a lot I feel like a wasted body or something."," Holy shitt !! This is insane. Your mom needs to be counselled by someone close to her - maybe your dad or someone she is close to in your extended family or some close friend she confides in and trusts. Talk to this person and seek their help. However, keep it in mind that when he/she brings it up with your mom, it shouldn't look as if you complained about your mom. If that happens your mom may feel betrayed and the conversation won't get anywhere.

This being a hardcore religious dogma which is not easily susceptible to reason, she is likely to go into a defensive mindset if she is rebuked or pushed aggressively. So, the conversation has to be carefully thought out and the follies of her ways have to be explained to her in a very smooth and non-aggressive manner.

In the meantime, be brave girl !! I can't understand how parents can do this to their own children blinded my beliefs. [deleted]","Does my period really makes me impure? I despise my periods not because they hurt me, but because of the amount of crappy rules I'm made to follow. It's unbelievable that people find it so hard to move on with time. If anyone of you have seen the movie padman, you know what I'm talking about. 

I am 17 and started getting my period at 13. And just as my period began I realised the shit load of rules my mom follows. We don't touch anything at home not even our own stuff. I am asked to just sit in a secluded room all day with a dirty blanket not washed since ages. I can't even go get myself a glass of water on the first day. Not allowed to touch any person at home not allowed to sit on my bed touch my phone or books anything else. Not allowed to go to kitchen or my own room. And I don't get a single speck of food on the first day of my period. And when I say a single speck it's literal. By the second day I'm so weak that it's difficult to walk. Even though agreed it's all for one day but my life literally stops.

It's not that my mom is a bad person, she is great and the amount of sacrifices she has done for me is unbelievable. But it's sad that even my crying for food doesn't melt her. She believes that because we have a small Mandir at home we are required to follow all this. 

Does my period really make me so impure?

Edit: Thank you for all the love and support! I honestly didn't know this was that big of a problem until you people pointed it out. Especially the not eating thing. I didn't know it can have long term effects. The problem with that is that if I force my mother to let me eat then she will make me stay in that hell disgusting room for whole 2 days. Sounds like a punishment for eating. 2 days doing nothing looking at walls. That disgusts me a lot I feel like a wasted body or something.  Holy shitt !! This is insane. Your mom needs to be counselled by someone close to her - maybe your dad or someone she is close to in your extended family or some close friend she confides in and trusts. Talk to this person and seek their help. However, keep it in mind that when he/she brings it up with your mom, it shouldn't look as if you complained about your mom.

1. We are definitely testing less than other countries. 
2. The real spike is yet to be seen. We may still have a surge of cases. Too early to say that we have less cases. 
3. We don't know what the reson is for lower virulence in indians. A newly discovered mRNA in indians might be protective, as can be lower levels of ACE2. 
There are other countries like Australia as well where they have very less mortality.
4. We really are in no position to handle a situation like new york or Lombardy.

Edit. We have confirmed reports that some hospitals are hiding positive cases.

Edit 2 . The hospital has come out with a press release admitting that they indeed have 3 positive cases. However, we have known it for atleast 3 days now. They hid it from the media for atleast 3 days,  maybe more. I have a question though, Let's say India didn't have 700 but 700,000 cases in reality.

Not testing would result in low count, but you would still have sudden surge in people reporting to hospitals wouldn't you?  Or even sudden surge in deaths related to pneumonia. 

I just think that if numbers were as big as some are claiming them to be, like in the 200k to 500k range. We would've definitely seen a situation where our hospitals would be overloaded and it would've been difficult to hide that in a country like India. For those who are thinking this is not true.  
I would say just wait.

For those who are thinking we should do more tests.   
I wish India had capacity for it.

For those who want India should have done better.  
India is still a poor nation now it would be getting worse.

d87kgb,https://i.redd.it/p3tuevj8xco31.jpg,"Equinox at Shri Padmanabha Swami Temple, Kerala",," Fascinating piece of architecture This is a nice capture ! is it your original content ? What is an equinox?

Earths orbit around sun is elliptical with sun at one of the foci of  the ellipse and happens in one plane. The axis of rotation of earth is tilted by 23.5 degrees with respect to a perpendicular to this plane(or one can say the angle between the equatorial plane of earth and the elliptical plane through which it revolves around sun) . Imagine a snapshot where earth is (tilted towards right) on far left of sun. Due to the tilt, the northern hemisphere is closer towards the sun than the souther hemisphere leading to a summer in the northern and winter in the southern. This position of far left is called as the summer solstice (wrt northern hemisphere). Yes , the position on the far right is called as winter solstice. As earth revolves around sun there comes another position which is in between the two solstices, called as an equinox where a person standing at the equator will have the sun exactly above his/her head in the noon. This day is also called as a no shadow day for the equator. I,e, if a vertical body (with almost no width) is kept in the noon , you won't be able to see its shadow(theoretically). Such a no shadow day occurs only twice in a year for a location in between 23.5 deg North and 23.5 deg South latitudes. There are no no shadow days   beyond those latitudes. The day of no shadow for the equator is termed as an equinox. 

PS: The equator does not pass through India , therefore today is not a no shadow day for us. If anybody wishes to know more about it I can explain it in much detail. It is quite easy and fun to learn.","Equinox at Shri Padmanabha Swami Temple, Kerala   Fascinating piece of architecture This is a nice capture ! is it your original content ? What is an equinox?

Earths orbit around sun is elliptical with sun at one of the foci of  the ellipse and happens in one plane. The axis of rotation of earth is tilted by 23.5 degrees with respect to a perpendicular to this plane(or one can say the angle between the equatorial plane of earth and the elliptical plane through which it revolves around sun) . Imagine a snapshot where earth is (tilted towards right) on far left of sun. Due to the tilt, the northern hemisphere is closer towards the sun than the souther hemisphere leading to a summer in the northern and winter in the southern. This position of far left is called as the summer solstice (wrt northern hemisphere). Yes , the position on the far right is called as winter solstice. As earth revolves around sun there comes another position which is in between the two solstices, called as an equinox where a person standing at the equator will have the sun exactly above his/her head in the noon. This day is also called as a no shadow day for the equator. I,e, if a vertical body (with almost no width) is kept in the noon , you won't be able to see its shadow(theoretically). Such a no shadow day occurs only twice in a year for a location in between 23.5 deg North and 23.5 deg South latitudes. There are no no shadow days   beyond those latitudes. The day of no shadow for the equator is termed as an equinox.

Who are these people? Are they professionals? Wow, Girls in band?

Well, This is called as ""Dhol Pathak"" (ढोल पथक). Number ranging from 10-20 to even hundred of Dhol players can be part of this band or Pathak. Back in the days, I mean before DJ's and Banjo's, in front of Ganpati or other ceremonial processions there used to be such band where bunch of men would play dhol and let everyone know, Ganpati or any procession in full celebration mood arriving in their area.

But now a days, This Pathak's are widely acclaimed. And hence they've got bit professional. There are number of Big names of such pathak in every city. Month before Ganesh Chaturthi this pathak will start recruiting interested people. Anyone, Girls, boys, kids can participate in it, anyone who has evening free for rehearsal. After recruiting every evening they gather, and rehears. The Pathak itself will provide the Dhol. So you just need to show up. So in that month they try out different tunes & beats. They try out different acts too, to make procession more interesting. After all your band can be talk of town. So after month long preparation, they are ready. Now There are number of Ganpati Mandals (Ganpati Mandals is term for club or circle of people who set Ganpati idol in their area with big pandols & all that) who book such pathaks to perform in front of their Ganpati procession. Pathak's fees can range from a lakh to several lakhs, depending on number of Dhol players in band. Well, Pathak don't pay to dhol players or some may but other than that they do take care of all the players. Anyway, In Players perspective this isnt about money but its for experience or for their own enthusiasm as its fun. And yes, Girls too, take part in this whole process.

Kudos!,"In one of the best sports performances in Indian history, Indian team of 284 athletes have clinched 368 medals at the prestigious Special Olympics World Summer Games held at Abu Dhabi between Mar 14 to 21.

Here's the mind-blowing overall medal tally:

- Gold : 85
- Silver : 154
- Bronze : 129

I had posted a just few days ago on how investing heavily in only a handful of ""profitable talents"" viz. dance, singing, comedy and cricket; and media's blatant neglect of other talents might discourage talented individuals from pursuing their interests in other fields of sports and art. 

And today I read about these champions of indomitable determination. They proved how, despite their hardships, special abilities and limited support, one can make history. One must also applaud their parents and well wishers for truly believing in their children when the world generally looks down upon people with special needs & abilities.

Most of these sports persons will soon return to their normal lives full of obstacles. I only hope that these men & women of passion get as much support and nurturing as possible from the govt as well as the society. They made India proud. They deserve to be rewarded and rewarded well for bringing glory to the nation. And more importantly for bringing a ray of hope in the lives of millions of others.

ef197b,https://i.redd.it/5juzv9fl0l641.jpg,Excerpt by Ahsis Nandy from his interview with Modi in 1996,," Holy moly, this is so bad. There's a video of Modi framing Jamia students as terrorists supporters. And we wonder why Jamians were beaten so brutally, even those not taking part in protest, nevermind taking part in protest is not a crime. Now they dipshit Police says that the violence was perpetrated by outsiders, then why the fuck these Thullas beat up students. It's Modi himself who ordered this. Creating a Nationality: The Ramjanmabhumi Movement and Fear of the Self

Authors: Ashis Nandy, Shikha Trivedy, Shail Mayaram, Achyut Yagnik As an almost 40 year old man. This makes me happy that the new generation has seen this what I have seen before and have been saying that since 2013. I feel my struggle has been paid off a little whenever I talked about Modi and his fascist intentions since 2013 to everybody. They all laughed at me, I was thinking way too much they told me, I'm crazy and my hate for Modi has taken a fancy ride, they told me.

Now I hope this  at least makes it all clear. You know how people say, once a cop always a cop. Well in Modi's case, once a piece of shit always a piece of shit. I always said Modi can never be this saint suddenly, he has evil intentions when he was brought to the centre of attention by very Desperate Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitely. They were so desperately wanted to win 2014 that they got this fucking terrorist who knows how to polarize and make Hindus hate everybody else. Almost every Senior leaders in BJP opposed that move. Vajpayee hated him to the core, Advani became doubtful and thought Vajpayee is right, other seniors were never in favor of Modi. But Rajnath the mofo as a Party president brainwashed his party's majority who has no clue who Modi was. That and sharp minded evil Jaitely. That was the end of the Seniors of  BJP. Advani should have listened to Vajpayee in 2002 to throw Modi out of the party and everything. If only Advani knew, he wouldn't have had saved Modi.

I knew back in 2013, when Rajnath went to US 3 times to figure out how Modi's 10 years US/UK Ban can be lifted, he wrote 5 letters to the US Republic Senators and others. Also he secretly flew to US to fork out how to get Modi out of the Rioting and Murder charges. It was said that once Modi holds a Diplomatic position, only that can make him move around places. But the Ban cannot be lifted and can be revoked once again once he loses Diplomatic seat. Very plain and simple. Now Modi as he is PM has cleared all his charges as a PM, like how Yogi Adityanath cleared all his charges by being CM. That was the plan by Modi's financers and masters. 

A month later SC got Modi's charges cleared, you know that Justice Misra and others and how they did it.

After that Rajnath as a Party president liked the idea of IT Cell and went ahead to fund it and created the propoganda machine which makes Modi a Saint and a Savior. That  was the start and rest is now history. And we all tried to tell that to people. They laughed and they thought I was a fool when I said Modi is Hitler back in 2013 and 2014. I never stopped comparing with him, cuz even Hitler came form nowhere and he was just an Officer during WW1. The way Hitler rose by the genius method and support of financers got him his position way up till he rise to power. That was the same way Modi did as followed by Hitler's Fascism #101. Modi wasn't created by himself, tons of money was spent to make his image in every possible way. I've been telling people that all the time. 

Now I only pinch myself when the world is saying what I have been saying since 2013. You guys have no idea how in disbelief I am, its making me crazy. I'm losing my mind when I read people now actually call him Hitler. And that he is, destruction is only his intention.","Excerpt by Ahsis Nandy from his interview with Modi in 1996   Holy moly, this is so bad.

I have been investing for 5 years. a year ago I had a portfolio of 59 lakh of which 45 belonged to my dad and 14 was mine. after a fight with my dad i had to stop investing as it was his account. 2months later he agreed to give me my 14 lakh and told me to gtfo.

&#x200B;

6 months back my mom got a bulge in her l4-l5 lumbar spine. my dad refused to pay for her treatment so i had to chip in.

right now my portfolio is at 10.5 lakh.

&#x200B;

I can only read and write in english. I can speak in hindi, tamil, telugu, english.

I am trying to learn python on my own. I have started to jog for 30min every day.

&#x200B;

I would like to finish a degree and get a job. what should i do from here.

thank you

edit: i would like to do a degree where 2nd language is not compulsory.  Upvoting for visibility. You already have done so much in life...I hope you can get through this. As for the degree, I'm no expert. Don't Worry Man... I was in your position with no degree not knowing what to do. I joined degree because some idiot cousin told my father that my dreams were unrealistic. Screwed around 5 years of my life , But now  I joined a animation Institute about to complete my course which was my first choice after 12th.

Even after all this I would not change a thing in all this because I learnt so much , met so many people, met my girl and hope that everything will workout.

> The moment I got that WhatsApp message on that fateful 10 August 2017 night, I did everything a doctor, a father, a responsible citizen of India would/should do.

> I tried to save each and every life which was in danger due to sudden stoppage of liquid oxygen. I did my level best to save those innocent kids who were dying because of lack of oxygen.

Here, English is taught by people who have never been outside of India. History is taught only about India, by people who have never been outside of India. How are students supposed to learn anything? We’re raising kids who parrot ill-informed teachers.

&#x200B;

Before you rip on his opposition, look up Messi's world cup goals. Most of them aren't against top tier opposition either. Guys chill. Chetri is no way near to Messi or Ronaldo. But on an international level he's scored more goals internationally than Messi. It's just how it is. India is still budding when it comes to football. We're on an amateur level, and for a position like this, it's a great achievement for chetri and Indian football fans to be inspired and put in the effort like he did. This stat doesnt prove that Chhetri is comparable to Ronaldo or messi. It only proves how indebted Indian football should be to him.","Did you know?   Inb4 people belittle Chhetri.

ffyots,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ffyots/my_covid19_quarantine_experience/,My Covid-19 quarantine experience,"I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China. Since it was Chinese New Year holidays, I thought I’ll head to Bali (via HK) for a short vacay and then head back to Shenzhen.
As the news of the epidemic becoming severe, I decided to go back to Bangalore,India.

This is where the fun starts:
- ON FEBRUARY 6, I land in Bangalore and the doctor in front of the immigration asks me where am I coming from and I say Bali and he let’s me go. (No temperature checks)
- at immigration, the officer doesn’t check my travel/visa history at all and I had to report myself that I live in China, the officer takes me to another officer and he just lets me pass immigration as they were instructed to only check folks who have a travel history to China after Jan 24

A week later I have a bad cold (I have a weak immunity) and since I have a crazy travel history and didn’t want to take risk and endanger people, so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected..
So I went to the official government center (Rajiv Gandhi chest diseases hospital) and report myself.
The staff were friendly and professional and they took my samples and took a chest X-ray and they found air-blockages around my chest and suspected it would be a pneumonia.So I was isolated and quarantined.

My family were not happy that I reported myself and the hospital ‘held’ me in quarantine for 2 days until my results came back ‘negative’ for the virus.

The quarantine facility  was not super great but clean and adequate and the staff took good care of me, provided meals and medicine on time until my results came out.
I was not allowed to go out of the isolation building and the family was not recommended to meet me, the silver lining is that the building was well lit with sunlight and you could hear birds chirping all day and you’re away from all the bangalore hustle and bustle.
It was a giant relief for me that the test results came out negative since I live in a joint family here in Blr.

TLDR; 
- travelled around a lot
- officers at the immigration were not very serious about the virus situation
- felt sick, reported myself and got quarantined in the government hospital 
- quarantine was not bad at all
- results for covid-2019 came back negative 

If you have symptoms, report yourself."," Appreciate u going the extra mile to ensure safety of u and others > so I call the helpline and they ask me if I spoke any Hindi (I didn’t) and they disconnected 

This is just disturbing to me. I understand many of the helpline workers they could scramble last moment may have been Hindi speakers, but i would assume they would atleast transfer you to someone who speaks your language or English. Just the idea that a caller from Karnataka calling in an emergency situation is required to know Hindi just baffles me. I traveled from Shanghai to India on 5th of February for an un avoidable reason and faced a very similar experience.     
     
I went straight to the immigration and asked them where do I need to report. Then they scrambled to setup the check up procedures.   
    

The authorities were very oblivious of the situation. The medical team was chatting in their room, totally unaware of passengers arrival. There was no proper guidance for arriving passengers. And I had to hear some horrible bigoted comments from the officials during the time of immigration clearance.    
   

Saw reports saying that a medical team will contact me at home to monitor my health. But nobody contacted me their either.   
   
I didn’t have any symptoms or infection, but I was worried and self isolated myself for the next 5 days, until my return flight to Shanghai.    
     
During this whole situation I had to go through so much of racist comments and rumours about China and Chinese on social media and it felt so disgusting. This was an opportunity to see how the world will behave at crisis.   
    
Now back in Shanghai, back to work safe and sound.   
Since factories are running on low capacity, the pollution levels are so low and I can finally see the blue skies around here.   
    
The preparedness and medical infra in China is manifold efficient than ours. I seriously hope that COVID19 doesn’t spread in India. We certainly ~~can~~ can’t handle this well.","My Covid-19 quarantine experience I live and work in Shenzhen, China and was traveling for work in the US when the virus epidemic happened in China.

I wanted to talk to him but he didn't first few days. I used to buy things from him just because i wanted to help him.

 Finally couple of weeks later, he started talking and i  cried that whole day. His parent died when he was too young to talk. Was living with some relatives who were real bad with him. He used to do all home chores but when he said he want to go to school, they took him to another cities bus stand and left.

Its been 6 months, I've been helping him in all the possible ways with study material, food and neccesory cloths. He dont want to go to any anathalay as well. 

There is a couple in mid 50s I know very well and when i talked about him, they said they are willing to adapt him but this boy dont want to become any ones responsibility.

Finally, he agreed on one condition that i visit him every week and the couple do not have to worry about this expenses. I know this couple from some time and i know he will get the best care.

I then maneuvered my car to block the middle lane, by stopping the car on the lane, with indicators on.

So I called the police. And an ambulance. I called the ambulance first, gave the operator a location, but he didn't know where that was, so the operator asked if I will talk with the ambulance driver and I agreed. I then called police.

As titled, the ambulance was really fast, reached the accident location within 5 min. The police took much longer to show up at about twenty minutes. We spoke with the police for about 5 min and went on our way.

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

She got many of us to take an interest in Indian culture.  Her gentle nature was soothing and hypnotic to us children.  She made us all feel safe and loved in a way few teachers could.  She was the kind of person that made you just feel like family.

Because of India, I have many fond childhood memories, thank you guys for sharing. Beautifully written , thank you Lupus ..

a4h2k6,https://visalist.io/india/all-visas/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=launch&utm_campaign=india,Did you ever get frustrated when you decided to travel to a new country? I made a site to help Indians find requirements for 200+ countries around the world,," Hi Reddit!

I spent the last 6 months trying to build [Visalist](https://visalist.io/india/all-visas/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=launch&utm_campaign=india). Now your quest for tension free visa requirements research is over.

Here's why I made this web app:  A year back I became a digital nomad and started traveling. I wanted to visit all the countries that I fancied. Soon I realized that you need a visa to most of these countries, few have VOA(Visa on Arrival) and for others, you have to get it through their embassy in your home country(in my case India). So now I wanted to see the countries I could go without waiting for 3 weeks to get a visa, did some research. After few blogs and websites finally got the list. Traveled to a new country. After few months I wanted to go to another country. I had to do the same search, couldn't find the old one, found a new site which had more countries offering VOA. One of my friends told me that when he researching for Vietnam visa, he found almost 10 websites with .gov and it was really confusing. Many blogs don't have links to official websites of embassies.

To summarize the problems:

* No aggregated info of visa related info shown in a useful way.
* Most of the existing blogs and website has very less info and are usually outdated.
* Lot of research is needed even to go to a single country and this needs to be done every single time.
* Difficult to find the official website and data on many websites is outdated.
* Pay more than required money to visa agent's

So I took the matter into my own hands and decided to aggregate this info, organize and present it in a useful way to the user and so [Visalist](https://visalist.io/india/all-visas/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=launch&utm_campaign=india) was born. While I was talking to my friends about this, I realized many people wanted something similar from a long time. So what this has is

* A simple way to find the basic requirements for all the countries you want to travel
* Simplified visa requirements like visa-free, visa on arrival, visa not required, evisa, visa required and visa refused (Yes! For North Korea)
* A simple map color-coded with visa requirements across the world so you can easily see which countries around you can easily travel to
* Visa Requirement details like duration, documents checklist and other requirements for the stay
* Which is the official website for that information

I coded, designed and built Visa List using VueJS with NuxtJS for the frontend, MySQL for backend using Golang. I was originally an android developer and learned these just to build Visa List.

I believe every person who wants to explore the world around them and would have faced the problem I faced, so could find value in what I have built. So I would love to know what you think of this and would be more than happy to hear your suggestions and feature requests. Let me know what you want to be added or removed or do I need to build something entirely!

Thanks!

It would be also nice to have a another filter called ""Visa free or E-Visa with a valid US visa"". Lot of people just keep the US tourist visa as it is usually valid for 10 years. Visiting countries like Mexico, Turkey etc is so easy (visa-free in most cases) if you hold a valid US visa.  This is great. One suggestion though. Instead of 0.5 hours ahead, maybe you could change it to 30 minutes ahead. Would be more convenient","Did you ever get frustrated when you decided to travel to a new country?

80toy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/80toy3/request_please_treat_your_office_boys_and_office/,Request: Please treat your office boys and office maids with dignity and respect,"Good morning everyone

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.

They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.

I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.

I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.

The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".

To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.

Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.

Establish rules early. ","Request: Please treat your office boys and office maids with dignity and respect Good morning everyone

Had an argument with some obnoxious colleagues in the morning. They are seniors who throw their weight around, and today spent 20 minutes shouting at a hapless office boy, for not keeping a glass of hot tea ready on their desk when they walked in.

They threatened to fire him and reduced him to tears.

I had enough and walked over to them and gave them their due piece of mind. I brought up the history of unacceptable treatment they've been meting out to the office boys and maids, snapping their fingers at them, abusing them over trivial matters, calling them for menial tasks they were well capable of doing themselves.

I stated very loudly that firing the office boys over flimsy charges would lead to cases in the labour court, and the office boy was stunned to know that was even an option.

The arrogant buddhas huffed and puffed and complained to the head of the office, who called me in. Since I work for the Corporate office and don't report to him, he couldn't boss me around, so he told me to calm down and not ""upset the seniors"" in the company. He told me that office boys were used to being treated this way, since ""it's part of their job"".

To anyone still reading, please rid yourselves of this attitude. Office boys and maids are human beings, not servants*. They deserve the same respect, dignity, and kindness you expect from your company.

Please make an effort to know their names (""Arre, Suno"" is not their name!!!!), talk to them once in a while, thank them when they make you a cup of tea, warm your food in the microwave, or come to your desk with some prasad or cake that some other colleague wishes to distribute in the office.

The college was not so supportive and banks were reluctant because for some reason I can't get study loan between the course, and some have not even replied till date.

I had offered to create app/website for randians in exchange of some loan, but instead the community came together helped me raise enough amount that I could pay my final year college fee, something i never expected from my fav sub.

I really want to thank the mods who helped me with the idea of fund raiser, 25 of you who helped me financially and hundreds of individual who offered useful  advice, kept asking me if I needed any more help, some were even willing to offer me internship/projects to work on to cover my expenses. It's due to r/India that I was finally able to [pay my fee](https://i.imgur.com/cmP1DXM.png) with a fine of Rs. 200 though.

May the force be with you, OP.  Congratulations brother. Keep fighting.","[Update] Unable to pay college fee. Need financial assistance... A few weeks ago I approached /r/India in distress, after rushing from banks to banks and talking to whoever I can, I was unable to arrange even 1/3rd of the magic 1.6LPM number which could help me pay the fee. The college was not so supportive and banks were reluctant because for some reason I can't get study loan between the course, and some have not even replied till date.

I had offered to create app/website for randians in exchange of some loan, but instead the community came together helped me raise enough amount that I could pay my final year college fee, something i never expected from my fav sub.

I really want to thank the mods who helped me with the idea of fund raiser, 25 of you who helped me financially and hundreds of individual who offered useful  advice, kept asking me if I needed any more help, some were even willing to offer me internship/projects to work on to cover my expenses. It's due to r/India that I was finally able to [pay my fee](https://i.imgur.com/cmP1DXM.png) with a fine of Rs. 200 though.

Wishing all the very best to ISRO! For people asking why ISRO is doing this:

We need to explore moon to find if we can set up a base. So that it will be like a pitstop for deep space missions. To escape earths gravity we need more fuel. But moon's gravity is very weak so we can carry more fuel and more cargo.

To set up the base we need to find if we have sufficient water and other essential minerals. Also to check if we can extract rocket fuel, so that we don't have to transport from earth. 

For ISRO along with all this, it's the first step in sending Landers and rovers for deep space missions like Mars. Sending rovers and landers to moon is relatively cheap compared to Mars if it fails. So they are doing it step by step.

Edit: Thank you kind stranger for my first silver.

Edit: Why we need to do Deep Space exploration:

Because we have such a big universe with so much energy and resources. We are fighting for limited energy and resources here, but if we could tap into the energy and resources of the whole universe including our own sun by building a Dyson Sphere, we will have unlimited clean energy. Then all the climate change problem, everything can be solved in an instance. We already have technology to convert carbon dioxide air into solid carbon but we are not doing it everywhere because energy requirement is high.

If you go back in history, the last dominant species of Earth Dinosaur died when an astroid hit, because they were not technologically mature. We have the technology to track astroid, but it's too difficult to find all astroids in the dark space. It may not be the astroid that will end the human species it may be something else, so to change our fate we need to explore to find a new home. For that deep space exploration is important. Also we as a species are explorers that is why we have colonised the whole earth, next step is the solar system (May be Mars and Titan-One of the Jupiter's Moon)

If something were to happen to earth it's impossible to save everyone at least with the current technology, but we can definitely save the human race. Here is the thing about space exploration: if you aren't doing it yourself, down the line you will have to pay exorbitantly to someone who did. It's simple as that.

If isro wasn't doing its thing all this while, we would've been paying some other countries to launch our satellites and stuffs, military tech and for million other reasons.

So if you are questioning why it's important to explore moon and other places, it's not for you. Maybe it's for the next generation, or the one after that. Or 10 generations from now.

Do we owe it to them? Hell yeah! Why? Because whatever shits we are enjoying right now wasn't created in our own generation with our resources, and so onus is on us to be not Dicks and handicap future generations.","‘The most terrifying moments’: India counts down to risky Moon landing | If touchdown is successful, Chandrayaan-2 will be the first lunar mission to explore the south pole.

I am cancelling my connections and I hope what I say in this post are compelling enough for you to support me.","I am copying and pasting from a [comment I made in another thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/adu4hg/indias_massive_jio_carrier_is_blocking_vpn_sites/edkyke4/), after someone suggested that I should make a thread about this.

Jio is using

1. Deep packet inspection
2. Carrier-grade NAT
3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6
4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options
5. Clueless customer service, who just say ""we can't talk about X or Y or Z"" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. 

The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.

To explain in more detail:

1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.
2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one."," The path that India is taking regarding privacy of a citizen is very concerning..

Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.
 * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.
3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.
 * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.
4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.
5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.
 * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!

I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one.  The path that India is taking regarding privacy of a citizen is very concerning.. They are trying to get as much control as they can of what we see on the internet and may manipulate us in doing other things too..Thanks for the explanation....Say no to jio Thanks for this details explanation. I had suspicion that the way Jio was expanding it would have their hidden interest behind this.  This is India, I doubt anyone is going to give up their free internet.

e5rae3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/,Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.,"Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our ""elders"". The only problem is that many of our so called  ""elders"" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. 

When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my ""culture"", ""riti-riwaz"" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random ""aunty"" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. 

  
My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  

This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! 

I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as ""Whatsapp university"" and ""Facebook pathshala"" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. 

Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. 

In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like ""bacche man ke sacche"" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. 

You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! 

How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!

The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the ""cultured"" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   


I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.

Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder."," I am not an Indian, but I share and appreciate your passion about social issued. I met many India friends here at America. I learned from them  about Indian politics, religions and histories from time to time. 

I am amazed by how India hold itself together as the world's largest democratic country,  overcoming the sheer amount of the fractions or diversities within the the society. Dialects, religions, sub-caste systems, custums, to name a few.  This is quite an accomplishment in itself.

It's difficult to move forward in unison without a center of gravity holding different parts together.  Nationalism and tribalism are such examples, good or bad.

My father does it occasionally when he wants to, and my siblings and me never do it. 

In fact we are all atheists, and when elders make ridiculous Facebook or what's app based claims, we debunk them on the spot.

7zbzbc,https://i.redd.it/7uz4s6nnuoh01.jpg,"Just one word, can we get those days again!",," My father worked all his life for the Govt. Of India, with a modest salary and not a single penny earned through dishonesty. I grew up in a sarkari moholla, where the families of officers much junior to my father were way more prosperous than us. I witnessed my neighbours buying one extravagance after another, while my father was unceremoniously throwing our people who had come with bribes.

One thing my father used to tell me repeatedly is that he understood systemic corruption and peer pressure could make young, ambitious officers turn dishonest, but he never understood why their families agreed to live off the bribe money. Why would wives not ask their husband's where the extra moolah came from, why the parents of such officers not reject the luxuries that were pouring in. My mother, much influenced by my father, was also a strict adherent of the same.

The point of telling the story is that men like this are not lost. They are all working quietly and tirelessly, and that is the true reason the Indian state hasn't come crashing down yet.  My father was in the army(officer) when the salary used to be abysmally low even until a few years ago. After he retired we settled down in a very modest apartment, unlike his colleagues, who bought bungalows in Chattarpur Farms and South Delhi. The contrast was painfully evident. There's no fucking way retired government officials back then(08-09) could buy bungalows in those areas with hard-earned honest bucks.

Imo, the salary asymmetry with other sectors plays a huge role in corruption. Also the limited avenues for promotion.

I'll give you an example of police. In state police forces, promotions are very limited & even then, political hand plays a huge role in that. Hence the police officers, from the lowly constable till the higher ranks of SP and all tend to accept bribes and wag their tails at the commands of even galli-level political goons.

Can you imagine a constable, who barely makes 18-20k pm with no incentives and promotions for 7-8yrs & above, standing at whatever crossroads directing traffic for a 9hrs per day, not even think of demanding bribes from the next vehicle he flags?

The system is designed to fail, be corrupt from inside out. Yes, there are honest people out there who carry the naam, namak & nishaan well, but with such dismal service conditions, the government isn't helping to stem the rot by any means. All people who are paying tax to the government in this era are doing the same thing. Who is paying the debt of Vijay Mallya, Lalit Modi, Nirvava Modi and many other people on & off screen?

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases aren’t that many but they’re increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesn’t. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested.

1. By covention the dissenting opinion is delivered separately from the majority opinion. 
 
2. By convention, the judgement is delivered by the judges in the order of seniority (Therefore the CJI was the first to deliver his judgement, even though he was in minority)

3. Therefore, the majority judgement (actual legal impact) was delivered AFTER the minority dissenting judgement was delivered

4. Media went on a reporting frenzy and confused everyone.

5. The CJI is equal to all other judges. He is only in charge of administrative affairs in addition to his judicial work.

Net legal effect: Instant Triple Talaq is UNCONSTITUTIONAL and hence BANNED with immediate effect as per the majority judgement.

CJI Kehar's judgement is merely a hypothetical judgement that the dissenting bench would have liked and has NO LEGAL EFFECT.

Edit: Added word 'instant'  Will this help finally pave the way for UCC? Good that this is got concluded. What doesnt make sense is how did this practice survive 70 years? What changed now? BJP will take this credit and rightly so. Modi has spoken about this on number of occasions latest on 15th August.

Yes, at a time when the BJP had hopes of winning in the midst of the Modi wave, and in a place that is their strongest constituency in Kerala, I think my second victory is a tribute to the work I've done for the people.
Plenty of achievements to point to, especially a National Highway Bypass that ahd been stalled for 40 years before i took up the challenge, and dozens more that have transformed the lives of lakhs of people. More details here: http://www.shashitharoor.in/mp-reports.php [I was the first Indian MP to issue regular reports to his constituents on work done] How do you see the situation of mental health awareness in India. As a person already suffering from mental health issues and getting affected by social stigmas which makes recovery even more difficult, I can say the situation is pretty bad.

>What prompted Shubh Kumar into this expression was the frustration and helplessness of seeing such a gross traffic violation before him right after he had finished an hour and a half-long session on road safety and how not adhering to traffic safety rules could have consequences for one’s family.

>“It was frustrating, knowing that we put so much effort into creating an awareness and yet people pay no heed to it at all. While I was frustrated, I couldn’t scold or shout at him. I didn’t want to make police evil in the minds of his children, given that the police are already seen by some as harassers of the public,” Shubh Kumar told TNM. 

>“I somehow had to convey that what he did was wrong! His children were sitting on the petrol tank, there was no chance of maneuvering the vehicle. It was so dangerous! He had put the lives of his wife and children at such danger. So, my immediate reaction was to fold hands and humbly request him to follow road safety,” Shubh Kumar says.

>Shubh Kumar says that he didn't fine the family, and also went the extra mile to ensure their safety when he found out that Hanumantharayudu didn’t have his driving license.

94hh5h,https://v.redd.it/d7jn4agq51e11,[NP] Hey r/India! I build and fly racing drones. Here's a short clip from my weekend at Bangalore,," [deleted] Bruh.. you got mad skills and looooooooooooove the editing.


How much for an Indian wedding? 
 I see a lot of questions so I thought it'd be best to try and answer them. 

What I fly is known as an FPV Racing drone. Unlike ones you buy off of the market, these have to be built off of parts you choose, are relatively small, made out of carbon fiber and are extremely fast at high fixed camera angles (think 140 kmph+). 
They are flown manually (no auto-level) and require a considerable amount of skill to learn to fly (simulators to the rescue!). 

This video was shot with a Gopro session 5 mounted at a 30 degree angle on the frame.

First of all, please note that this is a composite shot, meaning the stars and the Moon were shot separately and then blended together for artistic effect.

##Equipment-
Nikon D3100, Nikkor 70-300mm lens, a cheap ass tripod, one remote shutter

##Software-
PIPP, Autostakkert, Lightroom, Photoshop

##EXIF-
F/11, 1/800x 600 exposures, ISO 800

##Process-
1)Getting the focus right is the singular biggest challenge while shooting the Moon, so I spent a considerable time fine tuning the focus to get it as sharp as possible

2) Took more than 600 exposures of the Moon, and 120 Dark frames

3) Put all these into PIPP, which aligns all the exposures easily and uses the dark frames to reduce some noise

4) Next, the aligned frames are imported to Autostakkert, which stacks all the frames together. It basically takes the average of all the exposures to increase the Signal to Noise Ratio(SNR) of the final resulting image

5) Final processing done in Lightroom, then added the star background and blended the two shots together in Photoshop.



If you have any  questions/doubts or if I have made a mistake in the above explanation, please do tell me :) We take these images for granted. Never knew how hard it was to get the end result.

We have shown them how the central govt sabotages the nation for narrow electoral interests, and sanghi ideology. We have shown them how the central government knows so little about its own country, that it couldn't anticipate the reaction to its own decisions. BJP's arrogance will be it's downfall lol.

Long way from bollywood Bois. Gangs was a breath of fresh air.

They had a tight budget. They employed many improvisation techniques to produce it. Single shots without cuts, filming even when there was soem problem with the props.

It definitely is a great film for me. 

It has got rewatchable quality in it too.

Mine was a boys' school till 10th class and co-ed for 11-12. In 11, I had this huge crush on this girl and wrote a draft ""love letter"" for her. I must've put it under the bed, which mom found the next day during cleaning. She showed it to dad and I was interrogated at night by mom n dad. Like, literally; in a room by locking the doors from inside. My younger brother sensed drama and ran to the room's outside facing windows to see what's happening.

Dad asked me ""what is all this?"", ""Bol, mann ka baat bol, no problem"" and I said I like her. Instant backhanded slap. ""Ye umar hai ye sab karne ka!!! Kalse school band. Dukaan mei aake baithega."" My parents before : You can tell us if and when you get a girlfriend, we're cool with that. ""Usme koi chhupaane wali baat thode hai"" (that's nothing you should need to hide)

My parents after I (got a girlfriend and) told them about it : You shouldn't waste time on girls, there is a time and age for everything, college is for studies, not romance. Tried to eavesdrop on my phone conversations, snoop through my emails/texts, constantly stalked my gf's social media, all of that while refusing to meet her (and she asked them very nicely over phone if she could come over to our house to meet them).

Fast forward a few years, I'm fully independent and living by myself... I don't tell them anything about my love life at all.

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. 

Barun Biswas, a school teacher organized the villagers against these demons. He led the raped women to go to the police and media. The whole village came out to support the teacher in his fight for justice.

After that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.

In 2002, Barun was shot dead by some of the freed members of that gang near Goboardanga railway station while returning from his school. He is a real hero and people of the area still revered him as a legend.

* GLSV is isro’s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, delivering payloads to geostationary orbits.

* While PSLV places payloads (mostly earth observation satellites) at Lower Earth Orbit at 900km max, GSLV launches comm satellites at a whopping 36,000km

* GSLV MK 3 can deliver a mind boggling 10,000 kg into orbit at 36,000 km from the earth's surface in a mere 15 mins.

* How heavy is the rocket itself? 630 metric tons. That’s ~630,000 kg!!! Or as most news outlets have it, “five fully loaded jumbo jets.”

* The rocket is 43.4 m tall, flanked by twin boosters that are 26.2m tall. 

* Today’s payload is the GSAT-19. At 3,136 kg, it is the heaviest satellite to be launched in India (not by India).

We human space flight capable now.","GSLV Mk 3 launch as seen from my office in Chennai.   Some important points about today's launch

* GLSV is isro’s Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle, delivering payloads to geostationary orbits.

* While PSLV places payloads (mostly earth observation satellites) at Lower Earth Orbit at 900km max, GSLV launches comm satellites at a whopping 36,000km

* GSLV MK 3 can deliver a mind boggling 10,000 kg into orbit at 36,000 km from the earth's surface in a mere 15 mins.

* How heavy is the rocket itself? 630 metric tons. That’s ~630,000 kg!!! Or as most news outlets have it, “five fully loaded jumbo jets.”

* The rocket is 43.4 m tall, flanked by twin boosters that are 26.2m tall. 

* Today’s payload is the GSAT-19. At 3,136 kg, it is the heaviest satellite to be launched in India (not by India).

* It’s a telecom sat and also has science instruments to study space radiation effects on electronics.

For comparison in India, 50 lac ppl / children die every year to totally avoidable / curable maladies like typhoid, polio, child malnutrition etc etc 

Destroying an entire countries economy and causing the loss of livelihoods and inadvertently lives coz a few hundred / thousand  ppl who have some serious underlying conditions are gonna die  is not the smartest thing to do ( also over 90% are asymptotmatic as has been proved by Iceland which has conducted tests for like 20% of its population ; asymptotic meaning they don’t show any symptoms and go back to normal without even realizing) 

So again is this extreme step that has totally handicapped our country from ground up even worth it?? 

I mean I am sure soo many ppl would have died as a result of this lockdown itself, ppl who needed medical attention for some other ailment, ppl who couldn’t get their fix ( alcohol etch) ppl who lost their jobs their families and their minds (migrant workers getting screwed over anyone) 

I am not even including the multifold increase of ppl/ children  dying of the aforementioned maladies ( typhoid, polio, child malnutritionetc) that will surely increase by several multiples this year due to the lockdown itself. 

I think the entire thing is a fools errand and with every extension the returns are diminishing . 

As the reality is we might need to extend this lockdown till we get a vaccine in a country like India, as the lockdown by itself can’t curb this menace, and a vaccine might take two years at-least by the looks of it. 

So can we afford to go into an extended lockdown till then? I hope we don’t do that."," Unpopular opinion and sensible opinion aren't always the same, you need to understand that. I dont know what your designation is but I'm pretty sure you are neither an economist nor a doctor.

So about the lockdown, Lockdown has been enforced so as to flatten the curve of infection and hopefully by that time we might have a cure or a vaccine and I'm kind of sure the lockdown will be further increased as well, although if infection rates rocket up then the lockdown might be removed and herd immunity method might be used.

Next point about the maladies, TB,Cholera,Typhoid and such diseases have a cure or a vaccine, Sars-Cov2 has none as of now and we dont even know the mortality rate of the virus thus it can take more lives than those maladies if mishandled and for obvious reasons you wont like to have crores of infection at a time that might overrun our medical facilities.

Economy, the govt knows it better then you that economy will be hurt but what's important to a country is its citizens, economy can be revived but we can never revive a dead man, even our Ex-Prime Minister is in support of the lockdown and I hope you know who our ex-PM was and his designation.

End point - The Sars-Cov2 was a totally unpredictable event that happened and it might continue for the near foreseeable future, economies will be shattered, people will die, there will be collateral damage but at the end of the day humanity will always win.

Maybe the economically poor section might suffer, students might suffer from lack jobs in future, there will be emotional pain of losing loved ones and frustration over such things

But its a war and shit gets real in war, we can no longer think of our personal opinions its either support the govt now and follow or just shutup and let the govt work, creating confusions wont help in anyways.

After killing poor people in DeMo, MSME in GST, now his latest target is Startups. Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government. With economy already slowing down before Covid impact, and now in a state of paralysis, several promising startups will go under water, unless they receive investments. 

China is a key investor in several prominent Indian startups that lot of Indians use, from Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket etc though Chinese holding companies like Alibaba, Tencent etc. [Chinese firms have invested over $4 billion into Indian startups](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/with-4-billion-chinese-investment-desi-start-ups-wary-of-fdi-policy-tweak/articleshow/75228027.cms). Many such startups rely on Chinese funding and now will find it harder to access investments. Investments from US companies into Indian startups have already been slowing down, and during the global pandemic any source of investment that can keep promising companies from failing should be welcome. Instead the govt thinks otherwise. 


After China picked up additional 0.2% stake in HDFC, Indian govt reacted swiftly, without thought, by banning regular investments from countries that India shares a border with. China has already slammed this move, as it is against World Trade Organisation's free trade practices, India could be exposed to sanctions. With an already failing economy, this can deepen the crisis, leave several startups out of money and lots of people who work in the startup space without jobs and livelihood. 



Key question to ask are:

1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC. Yet China owns huge % of Indian startups and thus can exert control on these companies, as well as access data of Indians. 

2. What kind of thought was put into this decision? It's clear that Finance Ministry doesnt put much thought into most of its policies (as evidenced by the downward spiral of economy and key finance ministry portfolio holders more interested in goli maro than economy). But is killing startups during an already fast growing global pandemic crisis really required? 

3. What kind of relief will India provide to its startups? Indian govt coffers are already running on fumes. Just to deal with Coronavirus disaster, billions of dollars would have to be spent by the govt that will leave little room for other reliefs. Infact the only way govt can survive is by taxing already tax payers even further. In this situation, is Indian govt equipped to provide any relief to startups?


Many Indians have been celebrating the news of banning Chinese investments as if this is good news for the country. No it is not. It is stupid, unplanned and achieves no real purpose. Huge Indian listed companies like HDFC cannot be taken over by China so easily, while China already has lot of control on Indian startups, due to existing investments. Govt could have smartly brought about anti-takeover laws instead of outright banning all Chinese investments. Instead this govt has shown its foolishness again, and with scant thought has enacted a rule that will spray gasoline on an already burning economy. Without any thought, the ""ban button"" has been pressed yet again. The same ban button that has become Modi's favourite, for all situations."," China is a snake dressed as a puppy. Best blocked. Look how the CCP is protesting now saying that India's protections violate the WTO rules. Where were the WTO rules when lakhs of crores worth of state sponsorship was given to CCP companies to dump products everywhere at prices lower than the raw material costs, simply to kill the domestic manufacturers? You cannot even get a Diwali lamp that's made in India these days, and it is because local makers cannot compete with the state subsidized manufacturing and dumping by China. 

Honestly, if a startup is really good, money will flow in from everywhere. Companies like Paytm are not real innovations. They are data mining operations. Great startups have marquee investors from US, Singapore, Korea etc. We don't need China. 


They have taken over companies all across EU and Australia. They sneak in, then buy it completely. > Paytm to Zomato, Byju’s, MakeMyTrip, Swiggy Ola, Big basket 

These companies are hardly innovative and just do the middleman business but online. Too much VC money is not good for whole business ecosystem. These companies are subsidizing to create mono/duo-poly, and crushing down the other competing domestic startups. We don't want that. 

> Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? 

HDFC is a [systemically important bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemically_important_financial_institution). In short, a bank, insurance company, or other financial institution whose failure might trigger a financial crisis. They are colloquially referred to as ""too big to fail"". Owning every % of HDFC is like owning a part of Indian economy, So obviously Indian Govt. will loose their shit if China invest more in this company. > Indian startups are among the most innovative companies in the world, and have recorded huge growth despite negligible assistance from the Modi government.

Dude, what the hell are you smoking? Indian startups are mere copycats of Western businesses! Flipkart copied Amazon, Ola copied Uber, Oyo copied Airbnb, PayTM copied Paypal, Zomato copied Yelp, the list goes on!

> 1. Why did mere 0.2% additional investment in HDFC trigger the govt so much? Owning 1.1% of HDFC gets China no say in any matter related to HDFC.

HDFC Ltd. is a lending company with deep ties to the banking sector. Even a 1% stake lets them get into the board, and they get veto powers. A CCP-owned firm having veto powers in one of the largest banking organizations of the country? No, thanks!

While I agree that the finance ministry is daft in regards to various policy matters since it is controlled by the PMO; a veto against China won't kill startups. What kills startups are their lack of revenue management. Almost all startups are running in losses! How long will financers back these companies? Businesses exist to generate profit; yet most modern startups don't have those plans in sight (both Indian and foreign startups as well).

Why should government systems provide financial aid to companies, both startups as well as established businesses? That whole line of thinking is wrong in my opinion. Unfortunately, the worst precedent was set when government bailed out banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Yes, businesses have been hurt by Covid-19; and a lot of them have incurred losses as well. Isn't it part of running a busines?

What about densely populated areas likr Mumbai and Delhi or identified hotspots?  Chances of extending are failry high.

Even after cases subside the lockdown will be phased our gradually most likely.

What concerns me more is the economic fall out if it all.

It's going to be a shit show if they don't end the lockdown soon. Most of the population is in the informal sector. They need to get paid to survive. If businesses can't operate, they don't get paid. 

Even if coronavirus doesn't kill some, hunger will Domestic flights might also wont fly between any cities with active hotspots. Lockdown is ending only in areas with no case in last 14 days... Probably Goa and manipur only. Rest there is going to be phase by phase opening of areas with no hotspots .... Rest with areas having less no. Of reported cases will have to wait few days or only few things will open(DM can order) . And places with active hostspot will remain shut and lockdown will extend. ICMR should ramp up rapid testing and give passes to people who recovered and also who have anti bodies. Lockdown might will be partially lifted after 3 May. Hotspot remain lockdown.",Coronavirus

To be honest with you, there are many diplomas in medical jurisprudence all across the law schools in India. 
However, don't do those. 

Those are designed for lawyers intending practice criminal law. Therefore, what you learn in those diplomas is rudimentary anatomy, forensics and medicine.

Not doctors. Doctors already study that. In depth. 

There are no courses of medical jurisprudence for doctors that'll teach you laws. 

In fact, I was part of a committee to design such a course for govt Ayurvedic college. That one didn't happen eventually. 

If you want to gain knowledge of law, my advice really is, reading in general, and doing a diploma course around the lines of ""introduction to law"" .. 
Such diploma courses happen in most law colleges. 

That'll actually give you an in general idea of how to study law, books, case law search and certain basic principles of law.

Thanks!"," I am no expert, but went through this myself last December. Here's what I found.   
1. Very important: lifetime renewals, no exclusions for diseases like cancer etc., no restriction on number of claims per year, outpatient coverage (at least partially), good network of hospitals, claim settlement ratio etc.   
2. Somewhat important: online reviews on sites like mouthshut and reddit. This is important at least to me, because some companies like Religare have been known to provide fake information to IRDAI to improve their claim settlement ratio. Also, be very suspicious about the number if it is very high.

3. Good to have/not so important: benefits like gym/spa reimbursement, annual free health checkup etc.   
I started with Religare (through policybazar) but then spoke to someone who faced issues with the claim, and also read the reviews online.

They also have an annual free health checkup/gym or spa reimbursement worth 5k, and outdoor checkups till 2k.

For new phones, Samsung, LG, Asus, Panasonic are the top brands which are not owned by the CCP. You can try something from these brands. Of course, the gold standard is the iPhone, and even an used iPhone is a great option.

OnePlus has seriously become overpriced nowadays for the kind of product it offers, it's much better to buy a year old Samsung flagship in discount at that price.

g7o6sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g7o6sb/the_problem_with_indians_according_to_me_an/,The problem with Indians according to me- an analysis(Long read),"I have been meaning to write this article for months now, but because I am a lazy fuck, and always distracted I could not sit and do it. This is the best place I felt I could post this as you folks are open minded rational individuals. This will be long as I shall try to put in every observation I have had- please bear, and upvote so others can see and contribute.

Right, here we go:

 I am an officially diagnosed schizoid. You don't have to know what that is, just that one of its main features is **weak ethnic affiliation.** I have never understood group belonging and cannot stand patriotism. I have been kicked out of classrooms for spitting and tearing the tiranga. I do not understand why anybody would be proud of their nation. I can write an essay on this topic but I'll refrain so as to not veer offtopic. It is a biological aspect in my opinion- For as long as I can remember I cannot stand groups. Nor can I stand emotions, sentimentality and melodrama. It is my firm believe that religion, patriotism and emotions must be replaced by rationality, intellectualization, science and technology. So you can understand my daily existence living in an uber emotional nation such as ours. 

On the other hand I have an excellent ability to observe groups and analyse them. I studied in Canada and would score with distinction in my psychology classes on essays I wrote on analysis of cultures and people. It is a gift I am very proud of.  I have observed Germans, Americans, Canadians, Taiwanese, and of course my fellow Indians and analyzed their behaviour,character and nature. 

See, the problem with Indians is that Indians are **OBSESSED with India**. This is a strange phenomenon which is not observed anywhere else. The only comparison I can find is a fundamentalist Muslim who breathes and eats Islam all day. There is absolutely no other comparision. Sure, other nationals are jingoistic for their nation and faith- I see it in every nation. But Indians aren't patriotic,they are obsessed with the concept of India. Obsessed with the word India. I’m sure you know what I speak of: turn on any news channel and you’ll see. India this, India that. India kya bolega, India kya karega. India, India, India. Its like India is this umbrella or an invisible aura surrounding every Indian constantly. 

This nation is the worst example of a collectivist society. There is zero individualism- Nobody is an **introvert or an extrovert or a schizoid or a borderline…Everyone is Indian.** Go to any news channel and you’ll see someone say, “The world looks up to Indians,” or something along that tune. There is a nationalist *YouTube* channel called *WION* hosted by an Indian chick whose entire job is to gloat about the greatness of India all the time. I have literally amassed so many examples of Indian media literally lying through their skin telling the masses here about how that nation said something great about India, or ""look at how they respect India, when  upon researching its all utter bullshit. I remember reading Times of India and there was a small subliner with the words- Global Indian takeover! If you think North Korea is brainwashed you should see the people here- and its so much worse because atleast those poor Koreans don't know any better. But here, all it takes is one click to see if its true and yet Indians gleefully refuse to do it. 

Everyone just blatantly makes shit up. This is so strange to observe it boggles my mind. How can people be so gullible? Indians literally lack…they(we) **LACK** the ability to introspect. The cognitive dissonance is so bad it has to be seen to be believed. They will look at a blue table and call it red and be fine with it. On the one hand they masturbate to the Indian flag and yet have their visas queued up to leave at the first opportunity. I have observed this on individuallevel, group and state level and on the national level. 

There is an **Indian fervor** of the sorts nobody can comprehend.  How do you explain a humongous mass of 1.4 billion to all act in the same way – in a democratic nation no less – where they can look around and see for themselves? Indian culture is best, Indian food is best, Indian languages are best, blah blah blah. To make things worse people here are totally unaware of other cultures. There is zero interest,zero desire to know about the world, know about other philosophies, know about sciences or rational concepts.  Anybody comes to India and the idiot interviewers make it all about India- what do you think about India? Do you like butter chicken? What's your thought on Bollywood? Why the fuck would Roger Federer care about Bollywood? Why would they make Aamir Khan sit alongside James Cameron or Bill Gates asking retarded questions and giving retarded opinion? And why does NDTV always have Aamir present at every event when someone comes- Its like he is omnipresent. Does he sleep in their studio? Is there a secret tunnel from his house to the NDTV studio? Why have him as an authority EVERYTIME a foreign guest shows up? Do they have to have an Indian alongside everytime a foreign figure shows up? 

Anyhoo, Indians lack any knowledge of other cultures. Tell them about the wonders of the world, and they either feign disinterest or become downright hostile. Nobody behaves in this manner, not even the worst trailer trash redneck of Alabama. Indians operate on a very, very low wavelength. And you know what- This is the reason we have been invaded and taken over all throughout our history. We have always been inward looking, myopic, self centered and self obsessed. ALWAYS. The foreigner would look and go: Look at this bunch of idiots bickering among themselves, let’s take advantage. I am sure this is what the Brits felt and did. Like an anthill in the African savannah Indians are 1.4 billion blind ants oblivious to outside forces or the great land beyond. 

There was an Arabic polymath called Al Beruni and he mentions this phenomenon in his books, in the year 1017 no less(!!) about India when he visited. He writes:

**The Hindus believe that there is no country but theirs, no nation like theirs, no kings like theirs, no religion like theirs, no science like theirs.They are haughty, foolishly vain, self-conceited, and stolid. They are by nature niggardly in communicating that which they know, and they take the greatest possible care to withhold it from men of another caste among their own people, still much more, of course, from any foreigner ... Their haughtiness is such that, if you tell them of any science or scholar in Khorasan and Persis, they will think you to be both an ignoramus and a liar. If they traveled and mixed with other nations, they would soon change their mind.**

Isn't he spot on? and more importantly isn't this the way majority(perhaps 98%) of Indians are EVEN TODAY? I know its true because this is the nature of the Indian- Every fellow Indian I have met,be they an 17 year old nationalist or a 60 year old world weary CEO. **This contemptuous of anything foreign**. I do not observe this with anyone- else not the chinese nor the Pakistani. I would rent out a house in Ottawa, Canada and my impressions formed there were eye openor. The Chinese or Somalians would genuinely be curious about the local culture. The reason China is so far ahead is that they have taken inspirations from everywhere be it music, literature, science or architecture. They put a plan and implement it. Westerners analyze, interpret even willingly adapt foreign cultures if it suits their worldview. With Indians- with every one of them I observed the same thing- operating on a lower wavelength, zero interest,if not outright contempt for other cultures. India best, fuck the rest. What's worse is that in Canada they would want to room only with Indians, but then later they would form further subgroups- bengali, gujju, tamil. And then bicker and play petty games. This is what happens on a group level and on a national level. Bicker and show others down. Petty jealousy. I remember being in St Xaviers, Mumbai they formed a group in FY called ""terrible lingo"". The whole idea of this group was to, and I quote- ""speak hindi worse than a firangi would""! I have observed this with NRIs,so many times I have lost count. They'll try to show down the fresh off the boat desi. Its like its in the blood- this arrogance and the arrogance to put others down. 

Why do you think this is? Have you ever wondered? This nature?

I feel that a lot of this can be explained by genetics and especially the environment. India has always been a closed society. Perhaps the temperature (very temperate and tropical), climate, and the diet have made the humans here this way- content with themselves with no need to seek foreign lands. Another reason could be the way the majority of Indians are reared from childbirth- mollycoddling and risk averse create close minded individuals who are inherently fearful.  I have heard innumerable examples in many cultures in India where the children sleeping with their parents in the same bed till they’re 5 or 6 years old is not just normal but encouraged. 

Another psyschological factor could be ""learned helplessness"". The reason I mention this is because usually if a minority is repressed you will always see them fight back, retaliate or stage a rebellion- in all culture in all of history. Here in India even the muslims and christians join in the  Indian love orgy…Mera Bharat Mahaan meri Jaan mera Bharat. That is all you'll see on youtube or quora. Think about it- you'd imagine that the fact that they can very well see the vitriol the Indian Hindus have for them everywhere online and yet they are blind to it. It’s like it goes over these morons’ heads. There’s no retaliation. There’s no desire to fight for their background. They all revel in operating on a lower wavelength guided by ""aukaat,pyaar or dosti-bhai-chara. ""

 A friend of mine had a debate with a dalit and he was genuinely shocked to see that this Dalit not only didn’t want to overthrow the system of Brahmanism but actively supported the Brahmins and Hindus.There are many such dalits like this. I have personally seen these Dalits and lower castes working in my house (I am a rich Brahmin) all throughout my childhood. Not only were they fine with being mistreated but they reveled in it. This is dictionary learned helplessness which basically means a mental state in which an organism forced to bear aversive stimuli or stimuli that are painful or otherwise unpleasant becomes unable or unwilling to avoid subsequent encounters with those stimuli, even if they are escapable.The Dalit, perhaps thorough eons of such behavior, has become genetically programmed to enjoy this suffering. For the uninformed it is a tragedy,for them its the norm. 

But not just Dalits…To an extent every Indian is this way. Indians are molded into a slave mentality from birth. They are pussified. They are slave to the system, slave to their caste, their culture and above all slave to their mother and father. I cannot stress this enough- Indians for the most part **lack creativity** in any sphere. Zero creativity in anything, be it in schools, architecture, cinema or art. There is no Indian architecture like there is Chinese,Japanese or West Coast.Just look at our cities and it will be absolutely clear. I don't even want to talk about cinema. Nobody lives for posteriy, heck nobody even thinks on those terms.

You must be aware of this- all school and college is a burden of homework and rote learning. On top of that they are brainwashed in school with this fervent jingoism of the worst kind. It’s not even a manly heroic type of jingoism but the pathetic wimpy sort. Oh the mughals enslaved us. Oh look! Jallianwala Bagh. We are reared to be perpetual sufferers. No wonder there are so many emotional tunes all over the place in movies or news. Everything will have somekind of manipulative background score be it scenes in movies or in the news(!).

Indians grow up worshipping heroes and idols and authority. There is no self pride.  Go on any *YouTube* video of Shahrukh Khan, and there will be an idiot Indian professing that *Forbes* ranked him the 2nd richest actor in the world. How do you explain this? And there are so many threads full of discussions and debates if anyone dares challenge this. It's as if their own family's reputation is at stake. Just google the Shahrukh Jeff bezoz video and read the top comments. They are cringy, they reek of pathetic inferiority complex. As if Shah Rukh’s wealth and status makes their individual existence better as a whole.  Even when a video on cricket has nothing to do with India, they will shove India into the talk.They will shove Tendulkar in a debate on Bradman and Lara.   And they are too dumb to see how it irks others. Nobody does this- not smaller nations such as Pakistan or Sri Lankans. Only Indians. In a way with the prominence of *jio*, the world is knowing of Indian behavior and mindset.

Indians even *look* anxious all the time. I have observed this…Put them on a stage with a White guy and see how they react…Doesn’t matter if its a middle class guy, a big actor, or a top CEO. They become anxious. Their eyes go wide open. And often they start looking down at the earth. I have seen Amitabh Bachchan, Virat Kohli, and top CEOs behave in such manner. Its like all 1.4 billion follow the same pattern. Anxiety and fear. Utter lack of convictions and self-belief.

Phew, rant over. Will you hate me now? Am I already on some kill list? Look, I love my nation but constant observation has made me realize Indian culture is shit. Absolutely shit. The people here need to man up. Stop being emotional. Indians are incredibly emotional – it is cringy and terrible to observe.  One can blame politicians but the politicians come from the masses. Everyone here operates on a lower,petty wavelength. Infact I'd say things have gotten worse-in the 60s,70s and even the 80s there was still a good inherent nature present here. People dressed well, were polite and perhaps even humble. Bollywood films of that era are far better in their subject, execution and feel. But the past 2 decades or so its been a downward spiral.

I know most of you guys are different and I feel good about it. I have read a lot of posts on this forum and your observations and outlook are much better. Far better in fact.  It would be better if we started a clan or something and seperate ourselves from the mainstream which cannot change their inherent nature, let alone work on  politics and what not. But this is what I feel is inherent Indian problem.They say India needs a revolution, a benevolent enlightened dictator. But can a revolution even start, let alone lead to change? Can there be a ballsy, self realized individual who will take the nation by its balls- A Napoleon, Ceaser or even Churchill? I leave that to you. Would love some feedback.

Rishi", We dont question authority. And even I lived in Canada for 10 years and literally all my parents friends were indian... Its like they enjoy being stuck. At foreign trips my father would insist that we only eat in indian restaurants and for breakfast would only eat eggs and toast. Things that he was familiar with. We were constantly discouraged to make friends outside the indian circle... And racism always played a hand in solidifying it. [removed] [removed],"The problem with Indians according to me- an analysis(Long read) I have been meaning to write this article for months now, but because I am a lazy fuck, and always distracted I could not sit and do it. This is the best place I felt I could post this as you folks are open minded rational individuals. This will be long as I shall try to put in every observation I have had- please bear, and upvote so others can see and contribute.

Right, here we go:

 I am an officially diagnosed schizoid. You don't have to know what that is, just that one of its main features is **weak ethnic affiliation.** I have never understood group belonging and cannot stand patriotism. I have been kicked out of classrooms for spitting and tearing the tiranga. I do not understand why anybody would be proud of their nation. I can write an essay on this topic but I'll refrain so as to not veer offtopic. It is a biological aspect in my opinion- For as long as I can remember I cannot stand groups. Nor can I stand emotions, sentimentality and melodrama. It is my firm believe that religion, patriotism and emotions must be replaced by rationality, intellectualization, science and technology. So you can understand my daily existence living in an uber emotional nation such as ours. 

On the other hand I have an excellent ability to observe groups and analyse them. I studied in Canada and would score with distinction in my psychology classes on essays I wrote on analysis of cultures and people. It is a gift I am very proud of.  I have observed Germans, Americans, Canadians, Taiwanese, and of course my fellow Indians and analyzed their behaviour,character and nature. 

See, the problem with Indians is that Indians are **OBSESSED with India**. This is a strange phenomenon which is not observed anywhere else. The only comparison I can find is a fundamentalist Muslim who breathes and eats Islam all day. There is absolutely no other comparision. Sure, other nationals are jingoistic for their nation and faith- I see it in every nation. But Indians aren't patriotic,they are obsessed with the concept of India. Obsessed with the word India. I’m sure you know what I speak of: turn on any news channel and you’ll see. India this, India that. India kya bolega, India kya karega. India, India, India. Its like India is this umbrella or an invisible aura surrounding every Indian constantly. 

This nation is the worst example of a collectivist society. There is zero individualism- Nobody is an **introvert or an extrovert or a schizoid or a borderline…Everyone is Indian.** Go to any news channel and you’ll see someone say, “The world looks up to Indians,” or something along that tune. There is a nationalist *YouTube* channel called *WION* hosted by an Indian chick whose entire job is to gloat about the greatness of India all the time. I have literally amassed so many examples of Indian media literally lying through their skin telling the masses here about how that nation said something great about India, or ""look at how they respect India, when  upon researching its all utter bullshit. I remember reading Times of India and there was a small subliner with the words- Global Indian takeover! If you think North Korea is brainwashed you should see the people here- and its so much worse because atleast those poor Koreans don't know any better. But here, all it takes is one click to see if its true and yet Indians gleefully refuse to do it. 

Everyone just blatantly makes shit up. This is so strange to observe it boggles my mind. How can people be so gullible? Indians literally lack…they(we) **LACK** the ability to introspect. The cognitive dissonance is so bad it has to be seen to be believed. They will look at a blue table and call it red and be fine with it. On the one hand they masturbate to the Indian flag and yet have their visas queued up to leave at the first opportunity. I have observed this on individuallevel, group and state level and on the national level. 

There is an **Indian fervor** of the sorts nobody can comprehend.  How do you explain a humongous mass of 1.4 billion to all act in the same way – in a democratic nation no less – where they can look around and see for themselves? Indian culture is best, Indian food is best, Indian languages are best, blah blah blah. To make things worse people here are totally unaware of other cultures. There is zero interest,zero desire to know about the world, know about other philosophies, know about sciences or rational concepts.  Anybody comes to India and the idiot interviewers make it all about India- what do you think about India? Do you like butter chicken? What's your thought on Bollywood? Why the fuck would Roger Federer care about Bollywood? Why would they make Aamir Khan sit alongside James Cameron or Bill Gates asking retarded questions and giving retarded opinion? And why does NDTV always have Aamir present at every event when someone comes- Its like he is omnipresent. Does he sleep in their studio? Is there a secret tunnel from his house to the NDTV studio? Why have him as an authority EVERYTIME a foreign guest shows up? Do they have to have an Indian alongside everytime a foreign figure shows up? 

Anyhoo, Indians lack any knowledge of other cultures. Tell them about the wonders of the world, and they either feign disinterest or become downright hostile. Nobody behaves in this manner, not even the worst trailer trash redneck of Alabama. Indians operate on a very, very low wavelength. And you know what- This is the reason we have been invaded and taken over all throughout our history. We have always been inward looking, myopic, self centered and self obsessed. ALWAYS. The foreigner would look and go: Look at this bunch of idiots bickering among themselves, let’s take advantage. I am sure this is what the Brits felt and did. Like an anthill in the African savannah Indians are 1.4 billion blind ants oblivious to outside forces or the great land beyond. 

There was an Arabic polymath called Al Beruni and he mentions this phenomenon in his books, in the year 1017 no less(!!) about India when he visited. He writes:

**The Hindus believe that there is no country but theirs, no nation like theirs, no kings like theirs, no religion like theirs, no science like theirs.They are haughty, foolishly vain, self-conceited, and stolid. They are by nature niggardly in communicating that which they know, and they take the greatest possible care to withhold it from men of another caste among their own people, still much more, of course, from any foreigner ... Their haughtiness is such that, if you tell them of any science or scholar in Khorasan and Persis, they will think you to be both an ignoramus and a liar. If they traveled and mixed with other nations, they would soon change their mind.**

Isn't he spot on? and more importantly isn't this the way majority(perhaps 98%) of Indians are EVEN TODAY? I know its true because this is the nature of the Indian- Every fellow Indian I have met,be they an 17 year old nationalist or a 60 year old world weary CEO. **This contemptuous of anything foreign**. I do not observe this with anyone- else not the chinese nor the Pakistani. I would rent out a house in Ottawa, Canada and my impressions formed there were eye openor. The Chinese or Somalians would genuinely be curious about the local culture. The reason China is so far ahead is that they have taken inspirations from everywhere be it music, literature, science or architecture. They put a plan and implement it. Westerners analyze, interpret even willingly adapt foreign cultures if it suits their worldview. With Indians- with every one of them I observed the same thing- operating on a lower wavelength, zero interest,if not outright contempt for other cultures. India best, fuck the rest. What's worse is that in Canada they would want to room only with Indians, but then later they would form further subgroups- bengali, gujju, tamil. And then bicker and play petty games. This is what happens on a group level and on a national level. Bicker and show others down. Petty jealousy. I remember being in St Xaviers, Mumbai they formed a group in FY called ""terrible lingo"". The whole idea of this group was to, and I quote- ""speak hindi worse than a firangi would""! I have observed this with NRIs,so many times I have lost count. They'll try to show down the fresh off the boat desi. Its like its in the blood- this arrogance and the arrogance to put others down. 

Why do you think this is? Have you ever wondered? This nature?

I feel that a lot of this can be explained by genetics and especially the environment. India has always been a closed society. Perhaps the temperature (very temperate and tropical), climate, and the diet have made the humans here this way- content with themselves with no need to seek foreign lands. Another reason could be the way the majority of Indians are reared from childbirth- mollycoddling and risk averse create close minded individuals who are inherently fearful.  I have heard innumerable examples in many cultures in India where the children sleeping with their parents in the same bed till they’re 5 or 6 years old is not just normal but encouraged. 

Another psyschological factor could be ""learned helplessness"". The reason I mention this is because usually if a minority is repressed you will always see them fight back, retaliate or stage a rebellion- in all culture in all of history. Here in India even the muslims and christians join in the  Indian love orgy…Mera Bharat Mahaan meri Jaan mera Bharat. That is all you'll see on youtube or quora. Think about it- you'd imagine that the fact that they can very well see the vitriol the Indian Hindus have for them everywhere online and yet they are blind to it. It’s like it goes over these morons’ heads. There’s no retaliation. There’s no desire to fight for their background. They all revel in operating on a lower wavelength guided by ""aukaat,pyaar or dosti-bhai-chara. ""

 A friend of mine had a debate with a dalit and he was genuinely shocked to see that this Dalit not only didn’t want to overthrow the system of Brahmanism but actively supported the Brahmins and Hindus.There are many such dalits like this. I have personally seen these Dalits and lower castes working in my house (I am a rich Brahmin) all throughout my childhood. Not only were they fine with being mistreated but they reveled in it. This is dictionary learned helplessness which basically means a mental state in which an organism forced to bear aversive stimuli or stimuli that are painful or otherwise unpleasant becomes unable or unwilling to avoid subsequent encounters with those stimuli, even if they are escapable.The Dalit, perhaps thorough eons of such behavior, has become genetically programmed to enjoy this suffering. For the uninformed it is a tragedy,for them its the norm. 

But not just Dalits…To an extent every Indian is this way. Indians are molded into a slave mentality from birth. They are pussified. They are slave to the system, slave to their caste, their culture and above all slave to their mother and father. I cannot stress this enough- Indians for the most part **lack creativity** in any sphere. Zero creativity in anything, be it in schools, architecture, cinema or art. There is no Indian architecture like there is Chinese,Japanese or West Coast.Just look at our cities and it will be absolutely clear. I don't even want to talk about cinema. Nobody lives for posteriy, heck nobody even thinks on those terms.

2) some thing you have ( cc, CVV, loosely  OTP)

3) some thing you are (biometric)

There are hybrid identities like mobile number , etc etc.


Fraudsters can impersonate few but not all indicators.

So by adding more elements that are specific for an individual, they are making is difficult for fraudsters to impersonate you .

People should know, there is no security with out creating strong identity.  I'm talking about design.",Other

He's a top B School graduate, works in a firm with clients across the world and has traveled to more countries than I know the names of.

I was left wondering why he added the word ""liberals"" in his observation. To my small brain, liberalism is about freedom of thought. The definition is "" a liberal is a man who believes in liberty "" (From  [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/) ).

How is someone's love for freedom of thought considered to be anti-Indian, anti-nationalism, anti-tradition etc?

The bigger question is why are so many well traveled, educated Indians becoming so blatant in their use of political terms without any sense of what they mean? I often hear people use ""leftist"" as a derogatory term, but why? A government that's run by the left is usually more focused on delivering basic services to people, like health, education etc. while the one run by the right is more focused on allowing private sector to operate everything. In any modern society, both left and right ideas exist.

The person I mentioned thinks that USA is the capitalist mecca, but then why are trillions being printed to bail out corporations, and why are stimulus checks being handed out to the masses? Is that not a ""leftist"" response to the crisis? Most people in my circle have never read the definition, the literature of anything political, and their views and words sound as if coming from testosterone powered unruly teenagers rather than a mind with a sound intellect.

My question is, what can be done to improve this situation? How to make people realize that ""left"", ""right"" etc are terms with real meanings and should not be used out of context? How to make people see the good and bad on both sides?

Unless we educate people about different ideologies, we'll have a generation of people who became bigots (both left and right) due to ignorance and not malice. That's disastrous for the nation. "," I think the misinformation against the left has roots in people equating the left with communism, in particular communism as applied in China, USSR etc. People are not motivated enough to learn that these were the most haphazard application of the Marxist ideology, rife with blatant misuse of power. That's not to say that communism doesn't have it's problems with being too idealistic. But most people equate it with those, and thus perceive the left as evil. A lot of people also equate the left with Maoist Terrorists and such. A lot of individuals in the right do not understand that political views exist on a spectrum and all liberals, communists, and maoists are put in the same category, so to say. Certain Right wing supporters also claim liberalism as a western/islamic propoganda machine with the intent of erasing Indian culture. 


Why? That's quite simple actually - basic social psychology. There's a concept called In-group and out-group theory. People who have similar views/race/caste etc. are in the same in-group, and those who have even slightly different views are the out-group. There is no in-between. A lot of people have no idea what left right liberal conservative nationalist or centrist even mean. In India, this jargon is picked up verbatim from the words used by the right wing supporters. That's why the words ""commies"" ""leftists"" and ""Lutyens"" is used to describe anyone who doesn't agree with them. I had a discussion a few months back with a colleague who is an ardent supporter of the BJP and Modi. It had something to do about the freedom of speech and everytime she argued that this was being misused she'd say leftie and liberal freely. During a particular discussion she said these exact words - ""The government should just make all the rules and tell people what to do and people should listen or go to jail, that's the best solution"". I looked her dead in the eye and said you described Communism in a nutshell. She looked dumbfounded for a whole minute before another person piped in with ""left right centre, who cares they're all the same"".


The most recent years have taught us that education in India at least is by no way a measure of people's political brain space. This is most likely because the millennial generation has been dissociated from it for a better part of our lives and we've become active in it over the last decade thanks to the abject polarisation. A key point here OP is that you cannot educate somebody who does not want to be educated. People choose, especially in India, to be mislead and misinformed rather than face the reality of being corrected. I've given up arguing and debating with the right wing 


Also for the record liberalism doesn't only mean to believe in Liberty and rights, because even conservative ideology believes in Liberty and freedom. Liberalism is a more open minded view on religion, emancipation of women and sexuality. Conservative movements view this as an erosion of culture whereas far left movements view it as an abuse of freedom.

>	Our review of the records of that meeting reveal how, having imposed an unplanned lockdown, the government was not prepared even with testing protocols to track down those infected with the Coronavirus, which causes Covid-19. Confusion apparently prevailed, and experts expressed their frustration at the lack of action, despite prior advice.

>	The records also show, while imposing the lockdown, the government had ignored recommendations from its top scientists. Instead of the current coercive lockdown, these scientists had advised “community and civil-society led self-quarantine and self-monitoring,” through their research in February 2020. 

>	The research had warned of a large outbreak of the Coronavirus in India and indicated that the measures taken by the government until then were not enough. The scientists recommended ramping up testing and quarantining facilities, putting in place nationwide monitoring mechanisms and arranging enough protective resources for health-care workers. 

>	Among the scientists who conducted this research were several later appointed to the government’s task force on Covid-19.

>	Our review of the records of that meeting reveal how, having imposed an unplanned lockdown, the government was not prepared even with testing protocols to track down those infected with the Coronavirus, which causes Covid-19. Confusion apparently prevailed, and experts expressed their frustration at the lack of action, despite prior advice.

>	The records also show, while imposing the lockdown, the government had ignored recommendations from its top scientists. Instead of the current coercive lockdown, these scientists had advised “community and civil-society led self-quarantine and self-monitoring,” through their research in February 2020. 

>	The research had warned of a large outbreak of the Coronavirus in India and indicated that the measures taken by the government until then were not enough. The scientists recommended ramping up testing and quarantining facilities, putting in place nationwide monitoring mechanisms and arranging enough protective resources for health-care workers.

**New Delhi**: Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi and former union minister P Chidambaram were among a group of Congress leaders who went on a zoom conference call to criticise the government's move to freeze the hike in Dearness Allowance for thousands of government employees amid the coronavirus crisis.

""I sincerely believe it is not necessary at this stage to impose hardships on government servants and also on the armed forces people,"" said Manmohan Singh in the video posted by the Congress on Saturday.

""We should be on the side of people whose Dearness Allowances are being cut,"" said the 87-year-old two-time Prime Minister.

Rahul Gandhi, who had earlier called the move ""inhuman and insensitive"", raised what he called extravagance in projects like the Central Vista beautification in Delhi.

""You are building a central vista at the same time. So either you are not doing these extravagant expenditures...But you are taking money from the middle class, not giving it to the poor, and you are spending it on your central vista,"" said the Congress MP.

The Finance Ministry on Thursday paused the hike in Dearness Allowance (DA) for central government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) for pensioners till July next year. No arrears will be paid either, said the ministry. The move will help save Rs 37,350 crore in financial years 2020/21 and 2021/22.

""In view of the crisis arising out of COVID-19, it has been decided that the additional instalment of dearness allowance payable to Central Government employees and dearness relief to Central Government pensioners, due from January 1, 2020, shall not be paid,"" the Finance Ministry order said.

""We can make the point that when you have not cut back expenditure on bullet train, on the central vista development...those are the programmes which should first be put on halt, before you halt people's DA,"" said P Chidambaram, a former finance minister.

Some Rs 20,000 crore has been sanctioned for the Central Vista redevelopment project to revamp the parliament complex among others. Rs 5,600 crore has been allotted for a bullet train project linking financial capital Mumbai with Gujarat's Ahmedabad by 2022, to mark the 75th year of Independence.

The Finance Ministry on Thursday paused the hike in Dearness Allowance (DA) for central government employees and Dearness Relief (DR) for pensioners till July next year. No arrears will be paid either, said the ministry. The move will help save Rs 37,350 crore in financial years 2020/21 and 2021/22.

""In view of the crisis arising out of COVID-19, it has been decided that the additional instalment of dearness allowance payable to Central Government employees and dearness relief to Central Government pensioners, due from January 1, 2020, shall not be paid,"" the Finance Ministry order said.

""We can make the point that when you have not cut back expenditure on bullet train, on the central vista development...those are the programmes which should first be put on halt, before you halt people's DA,"" said P Chidambaram, a former finance minister.

Some Rs 20,000 crore has been sanctioned for the Central Vista redevelopment project to revamp the parliament complex among others. Rs 5,600 crore has been allotted for a bullet train project linking financial capital Mumbai with Gujarat's Ahmedabad by 2022, to mark the 75th year of Independence.

So I graduated in 2017 doing my BSc in CS, Phy, and Math from a tier two city. I got a job offer from a mass recruiter but I declined it due to not matching my personal ambitions and generally because I wasn't too enthused about my job prospects with them.

I was first very much into doing my MS in a college with good options and in a field that I felt was challenging and interesting to me. But before I could really do a deep dive and narrowed down the fields, I got to know that it's a high risk taking a loan for myself when my family is reeling in them worth 50+lakhs due to a new house construction.

I know I could have gotten a loan for myself kissing my family and the problems goodbye but somehow it didn't agree with me, so in short I decided to not pursue my MS degree.

I took a part-time job working from home with shit pay but I still put up with it and focused on the few positives, it being that I was able to start my own savings and pay for my own expenses. I left the part-time job last month because my payments got fucked by the guy I was working under (he used it on himself) and decided to become self-employed working in a similar field but with pay which is not fixed and depends on the availability of work and how many hours I put into it.

The WFH job which I'm currently doing is in such a field that I'm not particularly interested in nor have hopes of it sustaining future market fluctuations. But due to a lack of options, it seems like a 'something's-better-than-nothing' situation for me.

 So this leads to present day, writing this post and trying to figure out how the fuck am I supposed to move ahead. For reference, I'm only 24 and I know I have a life ahead of me, but it seems like all my doors are closing one by one if I don't take action for the future I want for myself, one with financial security enough to puruse my own hobbies and interests freely. Because I know in reality it's not that simple to get the best of both worlds.

Any further clarifications will be provided so please do ask me, but thank you for reading this. Any help or advice is truly appreciated.

g7dn32,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/g7dn32/is_this_racist/,Is this racist?,"Hello guys, I'm an ispiring author from Brazil. Love your country and culture.

So, to the matter I would like your opinion. 

Recently I finished my latest project. It's an urban fantasy/thriller where a group of young people discover they have powers of gods and creatures from various ancient mythologies. The major problem I found while writing this, was naming the characters, so for most of them, I named them with something that could reference the god they had the powers of.

For exemple, there's Fiona, who has the powers of a shapeshifting witch. Fiona being a common name for a white witch in Ireland. Also Diana, who has the powers of the goddess Artemis, goddess of the moon. For the one with the powers of Zeus, I named Edison after Thomas Edison who had a great deal of influence in revolutionazing electricity.

But the one I struggled the most to name was the antagonist, who has the powers of Apollo. Until someday I mentioned it to a friend of mine and she told me to name him Ravi, a common Indian name that means ""The Sun"". I loved the idea, and I made him have Indian ancestry. His ethnicity wasn't a big part of his character, just some background for him. Nothing wrong with that, right? Or so I thought. It wasn't until I finished it that I became aware of the problem.

A major part of Ravi's early plot, is his job. It's how he meets some important people, it's how he comes to despise the main character. I had written this part before naming him and giving him the Indian ancestry. He works at a telemarketing company. See the big stereotype now? This was never intended.

So now I come to think of it, is this racist/xenophobic? Should I change his name and ancestry or maybe even try to rewritte the plot with him working a different job? What do you guys think?"," We do telemarketing in large quantities. You could actually get a few people named Ravi with the same job.

Go on with it. As someone who also writes fiction, I don't think this is racist or xenophobic at all. Don't worry about it, so long as it fits with your plot. And good luck with the book. Wouldn't it be cooler to name the power of zeus as Tesla? As the Tesla coil when demonstrated have electricity firing from its ends.. just like thunder?
Just an opinion.. btw which language will the book be in?","Is this racist? Hello guys, I'm an ispiring author from Brazil. Love your country and culture.

I thought the purpose of lockdown was too buy time so that it can ease hospitals, and Government could arrange necessary steps to tackle this virus.","
Copied this comment to highlight my point. 

""Only from the economic effects. There are less old people and way less people with severe health conditions (who in our rich western nations are only alive because of the health service anyway). 65% of India's population is under 35 - they are at no risk at all from CV19. The median age is 26.8 compared to the USA 38.2. Tuberculosis kills 220,000 people every year in India and that is a disease that already has a vaccine. So far the country is in lockdown for a massive total of 680 CV19 deaths.

It is absolutely crazy that these countries are attempting a 'lockdown' strategy, when 3,000 children die from starvation every day in India. It's completely pointless, the extra mortality from CV19 will only be a blip for India, the mortality from the extra starvation deaths alone, let alone the ensuing economic consequences, will be way, way worse."" - Ilovewillsface



I think they got enough time. This virus is not as dangerous as they say it is and it also hasn't caused much damage. More people die from accidents, other health issues. I think India is strong and immune to face this virus without lockdown. Why can't we just move on and live with it? I think we're overreacting and unnecessarily damaging economy and it's affecting healthy non infected people as they're facing job loss, hunger, recession and depression, & suicides. 

It looks like Government is not in the mood to remove lockdown till next year. How much time does Government need before it can go on attack mode against covid."," There are more causes than the reported ones. Community transmission is already prevalent in major cities. Lockdown is nothing but a 'pause' button. Lockdown gave valuable time for mass testing, which India failed terribly. Its too late now. Lockdown or no lockdown, it isn't gonna make a difference imo unless you do more testing. Indian Govt is probably backing the concept of 'herd immunity, '  while it has a lot of pro, it could also end up killing thousands, if not lakhs. 
I'll say this once again, India screwed up their chance to break the transmission. 
Now they'll do some P.R. and since 80% CoV patients cures themselves.. They will be hoping that everyone just 'forgets' and move on.

Arushi was teaching at The Newtown School, Kolkata for the past one year, and she had given her resignation in the end of the month of February, and by contract she was meant to serve a notice period of 2 months that was to end on 29th of April. The school closed off temporarily due to the coronavirus lockdown eventually, as every other school did. On the 17th of April, she sent a mail to the school HR asking for instructions on how to go about the exit procedure. To which, the HR replied that the school no longer requires her services after the 15th of April (which was a date **before** she even sent her query letter) and that her notice period is being waived off.

The school also chose to do this in the time of such a global crisis where the government has continually requested institutions and organizations to not lay off employees for the sake of the employees' families.

What should we do? I'm not going to name my friend for the sake of privacy so let's call her Arushi. Arushi was teaching at The Newtown School, Kolkata for the past one year, and she had given her resignation in the end of the month of February, and by contract she was meant to serve a notice period of 2 months that was to end on 29th of April. The school closed off temporarily due to the coronavirus lockdown eventually, as every other school did. On the 17th of April, she sent a mail to the school HR asking for instructions on how to go about the exit procedure. To which, the HR replied that the school no longer requires her services after the 15th of April (which was a date **before** she even sent her query letter) and that her notice period is being waived off. This was done without **any** prior notice at all and even though she was doing her duties completely sincerely.

He has Leukemia ( diagnosed in 2016) and  **Bronchitis** and he's been so paranoid about the whole coronavirus precautions, I think something has gone wrong with him I think he needs professional help.

&#x200B;

* He wears a mask almost all the time Inside the house
* Our house is on the 4th floor and opens from both sides. IDK how but he thinks the air will bring in particles of coronavirus so we've been living with closed doors and very poor ventilation for the past 1 month.
* We also own the roof rights but since he is afraid of the Air, he doesn't allow anyone to go there and for breathing fresh air. he rarely stands at the balcony.
* He doesn't want anybody to use AC in the house because of...( pretty obv by now)
* Nobody comes in or goes out of the house. The last time we went for a grocery run was like a month ago. We've been fueled by just that. 2 times daal roti a day, almost every day. Fruits sometimes. He thinks anyone can bring the virus inside the house. Ration will probably run out in a week I have no idea what we're gonna do. The last time I ate a green vegetable was also a month ago. He Doesn't allow us to buy vegetables either from the street hawkers or online marts.
* Just when the lockdown started, our water purifier broke down ( eff you Kent ) . for the first few days, we were drinking tap water by boiling it and then cooling it rapidly. Then he got paranoid that it's affecting his kidney so we somehow managed to bring in a few crates of bisleri 1l bottle. They'll run out soon.
* Someone told him not to put the phone on the ear while talking so now we all talk on speakers or earphones.
* He has had a total of 15 or 16 hours of sleep in the last 7 days. Takes a sleeping pill but it only affects him for 2 hours. ( its a 5mg). Too scared to take any more than that. Hasn't had any fresh air for the past month.
* Has constant headaches and migraines.

Long story short,  he is quite bad and literally on the border. He cries a lot these days and it breaks my heart to see him like this.

So here's the thing. He just wants to go back to the family house in UP ( Moradabad ). He's been having a guilt trip of not leaving the city in time and I don't know how to get us(family of 4) there. Is there a way I can leave border into UP without being stopped. \[ ***he also thinks that as soon as we try to go for the border, they will lock us up in quarantine wards \]***.

&#x200B;

I'm not looking for medical help. Trust me, I've tried, Counselors, Psychiatrists , NIHMANS Helpline. All of it. Nothing worked and I doubt anything will. It's just the last hope. To go back to Moradabad for some reason. If this goes on, He'll either Die by the end or either I'll commit suicide because you can't possibly begin to think how difficult it is here. I just need a way to cross the border somehow without being denied or being put into quarantine.

Once corona patients are admitted to hospitals, no communication is received till the patient dies or recovers.

Government does not have a clear plan on what to do with dead bodies. If they hand over it to relative, they are unable to carry the patients to their home or near by funeral centres.

If there is no nearby funeral centre, even hospital would not want to take risk of taking care of cremation. Hospital also would not want to use those dead bodies for lab.

If the family recovers from corona, they are not allowed back to the village/society, even though, they are showing certificate of recovery from the hospital. They are forced to go in hiding.

However, there is another perspective too.","Unpopular Opinion: As someone who is not a BJP voter, I begrudgingly admit that the centre government's response to Covid has been as good as any central government could've given And No, this is not going to change the way I vote in 2022 (and 2024) as yet.

The way Central Govt has brought dissident states like Bengal back in line and [has taken the charge](https://theprint.in/india/8-am-to-midnight-its-out-of-sight-amit-shah-whos-quietly-managing-indias-covid-crisis/407424/), 360 degree, 24x7 [co-ordination](https://theprint.in/india/8-am-to-midnight-its-out-of-sight-amit-shah-whos-quietly-managing-indias-covid-crisis/407424/), the new FDI rule - it does feel that they are on top of things. The amount people are willing to go through for someone they've only ever seen on TV is almost unreal, and the way many are genuinely following the lockdown in most cities is incredible.

Of course, some of it has been overshadowed by overt minority bashing, occasionally [daft recommendations](https://theprint.in/india/modi-govt-wants-states-to-start-producing-herbal-remedy-for-covid-19-immunity-sends-recipe/408931/) and foolish theatrics of *thaali peeto.* But that has been a travesty since 2014, some good with a generous smattering of [foolish](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/demonetisation-caused-3-percentage-point-decline-jobs-economic-activity/story/383338.html).

I'm not beset with an all consuming hatred for the government, to the point that I'm ready to see Indian lives lost and utter mayhem to see the government fall.

This is a quick and reliable list of the top 10 motivational speakers for your next conference or event in 2020.

1. Naseer Khan: He tops the list because he is the best for ""live"" events. And he's truly an international speaker as he's been speaking around the world. Nobody beats Naseer when is comes to creating a rock concert kind of euphoria. He uses music, NLP, hypnosis, exercises, and videos etc. to make his 3-5 hour long motivational events truly engaging and result producing.

Master of both English and Hindi, he's also the author of self help masterpiece ""The Gift of Happiness and Success"".

He was recently invited as a keynote speaker at The World Confluence of Humanity, Power & Spirituality.

2. Sandeep Maheshwari: He's an online heartthrob. Extremely popular among the Hindi speaking youth. Sandeep is mainly a Youtube motivational speaker.

3. Vivek Bindra: He's famous for his case studies on YouTube. Less of a motivational speaker and more of a business consultant for the masses. He's known for his high energy body language.

4. Simerjeet Singh: Hotelier turned motivator, he's a world class motivational speaker known for his soothing voice and recorded poetry.

5. Himeesh Madaan: He's a young funny motivational speaker and Youtuber. Mainly speaks to college youth in Hindi.

6. Priya Kumar: She's one of the few female motivational speakers in India known for the books she has authored and fire walking experience.

7. Shiv Khera: Though his initial magic is fading, he's still the veteran motivational speaker of India. Shiv is the author of 3 best-selling books.

8. Ujjwal Patni: Ujjwal hails from Raipur Chhattisgarh and is popular among Hindi speaking youth. His simple books have made him one of the well known inspirational speakers in the country.

9. Akash Gautam: He's known for his difficult vocabulary. Akash claims to have memorized the whole of Oxford dictionary. He's a sarcastic speaker by his own claims.

10. Yogesh Chabria: He's also one of the top motivational speakers in India, calls himself a Happionaire. He mainly speaks on sales and finances.", This post is about my observation on motivational speakers in India for live events.
