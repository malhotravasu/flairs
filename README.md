The Data has been scraped.
Models are already trained and serialized.
Parameter tuning is complete and document embeddings have been learnt.
Flask Web App (Backend + Frontend) is complete and working fabulously.

The only concern left unresolved is the Heroku Slug size. My complete application after a trim-down compiles to 582MB whereas the maximum allowed Slug size on Heroku is 500MB.

Please give me some time to resolve that issue!
